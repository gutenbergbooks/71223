      <h2 class="nobreak" id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>The object of this book is to trace some strands in the development of
      religious thought on social and economic questions in the period which saw
      the transition from medieval to modern theories of social organization. It
      does not carry the subject beyond the beginning of the eighteenth century,
      and it makes no pretense of dealing with the history either of economic
      theory or of economic practice, except in so far as theory and practice
      were related to changes in religious opinion. In reality, however, the
      connection between them was intimate and vital. The revolutions, at once
      religious, political and social, which herald the transition from the
      medieval to the modern world, were hardly less decisive for the economic
      character of the new civilization than for its ecclesiastical organization
      and religious doctrines. The economic categories of modern society have
      their roots in the economic expansion and social convulsions which
      accompanied the age of the Renaissance and the Reformation.</p>
      <p>The history of religious thought on questions of social ethics is a
      topic which has been treated in England by the late Dr. Cunningham, by Sir
      William Ashley, whose essay on <i>The Canonist Doctrine</i> first
      interested me in the subject, by Mr. G. G. Coulton, Mr. H. G. Wood, and
      Mr. G. O’Brien. But it is no reflection on their work to say that the most
      important contributions of recent years have come from continental
      students, in particular Troeltsch, Choisy, Sombart, Brentano, Levy and,
      above all, Max Weber, whose celebrated essay on <i>Die Protestantische
      Ethik und der Geist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span> des
      Kapitalismus</i> gave a new turn to the discussion. No one can work, on
      however humble a scale, in the same field, without being conscious of the
      heavy obligation under which these scholars have laid him. While I have
      not always been able to accept their conclusions, I am glad to have this
      opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to them. I regret that Mr.
      Coulton’s <i>The Mediæval Village</i> appeared too late for me to make use
      of its abundant stores of learning and insight.</p>
      <p>It only remains for me to thank the friends whose assistance has
      enabled me to make this book somewhat less imperfect than it would
      otherwise have been. Mr. J. L. Hammond, Dr. E. Power, and Mr. A. P.
      Wadsworth have been kind enough to read, and to improve, the manuscript.
      Professor J. E. Neale, in addition to reading the proofs, has helped me
      most generously throughout with advice and criticism. I am deeply indebted
      both to Miss Bulkley, who has undertaken the thankless task of correcting
      the proofs and making an index, and to the London School of Economics and
      the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund for enabling me to make use of
      her services. My obligation to the help given by my wife is beyond
      acknowledgment.</p>

      development of social theory can hardly hope to avoid the criticism which
      is brought against those who disturb the dust in forgotten lumber-rooms.
      If he seeks an excuse beyond his own curiosity, he may find it, perhaps,
      in the reflection that the past reveals to the present what the present is
      capable of seeing, and that the face which to one age is a blank may to
      another be pregnant with meaning. Writing when economic science was in the
      first flush of its dogmatic youth, it was natural that Say should dismiss
      as an unprofitable dilettantism an interest in the speculations of ages
      unillumined by the radiance of the new Gospel. But to determine the
      significance of opinion is, perhaps, not altogether so simple a matter as
      he supposed. Since the brave days when Torrens could say of Political
      Economy, “Twenty years hence there will scarcely exist a doubt respecting
      any of its fundamental principles,”[<a href="#footnote-1-2"
      id="noteref-1-2">2</a>] how many confident certainties have been
      undermined! How many doctrines once dismissed as the emptiest of
      superstitions have revealed an unsuspected vitality!</p>
      <p>The attempt to judge economic activity and social organization by
      ethical criteria raises problems which are eternal, and it is possible
      that a study of the thought of an age when that attempt was made, if with
      little success, at least with conviction and persistence, may prove, even
      today, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> wholly without
      instruction. In the present century, the old issues seem, indeed, to have
      acquired a new actuality. The philosophy which would keep economic
      interests and ethical idealism safely locked up in their separate
      compartments finds that each of the prisoners is increasingly restive. On
      the one hand, it is evident that the whole body of regulations, by which
      modern societies set limits to the free play of economic self-interest,
      implies the acceptance, whether deliberate or unconscious, of moral
      standards, by reference to which certain kinds of economic conduct are
      pronounced illegitimate. On the other hand, there are indications that
      religious thought is no longer content to dismiss the transactions of
      business and the institutions of society as matters irrelevant to the life
      of the spirit.</p>
      <p>Silently, but unmistakably, the conception of the scope and content of
      Christian ethics which was generally, though not universally, accepted in
      the nineteenth century, is undergoing a revision; and in that revision the
      appeal to the experience of mankind, which is history, has played some
      part, and will play a larger one. There have been periods in which a tacit
      agreement, accepted in practice if not stated in theory, excluded economic
      activities and social institutions from examination or criticism in the
      light of religion. A statesman of the early nineteenth century, whose
      conception of the relations of Church and State appears to have been
      modeled on those of Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine de Bourgh, is said to
      have crushed a clerical reformer with the protest, “Things have come to a
      pretty pass if religion is going to interfere with private life”; and a
      more recent occupant of his office has explained the catastrophe which
      must follow, if the Church crosses the Rubicon which divides the outlying
      provinces of the spirit from the secular capital of public affairs.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-3" id="noteref-1-3">3</a>]</p>
      <p>Whatever the merit of these aphorisms, it is evident today that the
      line of division between the spheres of religion<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> and secular business, which they assume as
      self-evident, is shifting. By common consent the treaty of partition has
      lapsed and the boundaries are once more in motion. The age of which
      Froude, no romantic admirer of ecclesiastical pretensions, could write,
      with perhaps exaggerated severity, that the spokesmen of religion “leave
      the present world to the men of business and the devil,”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-4" id="noteref-1-4">4</a>] shows some signs of drawing
      to a close. Rightly or wrongly, with wisdom or with its opposite, not only
      in England but on the Continent and in America, not only in one
      denomination but among Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and Nonconformists, an
      attempt is being made to restate the practical implications of the social
      ethics of the Christian faith, in a form sufficiently comprehensive to
      provide a standard by which to judge the collective actions and
      institutions of mankind, in the sphere both of international politics and
      of social organization. It is being made today. It has been made in the
      past. Whether it will result in any new synthesis, whether in the future
      at some point pushed farther into the tough world of practical affairs men
      will say,</p>

      is that, as in the analogous problem of the relations between Church and
      State, issues which were thought to have been buried by the discretion of
      centuries have shown in our own day that they were not dead, but sleeping.
      To examine the forms which they have assumed and the phases through which
      they have passed, even in the narrow field of a single country and a
      limited period, is not mere antiquarianism. It is to summon the living,
      not to invoke a corpse, and to see from a new angle the problems of our
      own age, by widening the experience brought to their consideration.<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>
      <p>In such an examination the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are
      obviously a critical period. Dr. Figgis[<a href="#footnote-1-5"
      id="noteref-1-5">5</a>] has described the secularization of political
      theory as the most momentous of the intellectual changes which ushered in
      the modern world. It was not the less revolutionary because it was only
      gradually that its full consequences became apparent, so that seeds which
      were sown before the Reformation yielded their fruit in England only after
      the Civil War. The political aspects of the transformation are familiar.
      The theological mould which shaped political theory from the Middle Ages
      to the seventeenth century is broken; politics becomes a science,
      ultimately a group of sciences, and theology at best one science among
      others. Reason takes the place of revelation, and the criterion of
      political institutions is expediency, not religious authority. Religion,
      ceasing to be the master-interest of mankind, dwindles into a department
      of life with boundaries which it is extravagant to overstep.</p>
      <p>The ground which it vacates is occupied by a new institution, armed
      with a novel doctrine. If the Church of the Middle Ages was a kind of
      State, the State of the Tudors had some of the characteristics of a
      Church; and it was precisely the impossibility, for all but a handful of
      sectaries, of conceiving a society which treated religion as a thing
      privately vital but publicly indifferent, which in England made
      irreconcilable the quarrel between Puritanism and the monarchy. When the
      mass had been heated in the furnace of the Civil War, its component parts
      were ready to be disengaged from each other. By the end of the seventeenth
      century the secular State, separate from the Churches, which are
      subordinate to it, has emerged from the theory which had regarded both as
      dual aspects of a single society. The former pays a shadowy deference to
      religion; the latter do not meddle with the external fabric of the
      political and social system, which is the concern of the former. The
      age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> of religious struggles
      virtually ends with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. The age of the wars
      of economic nationalism virtually begins with the war between England and
      Holland under the Commonwealth and Charles <abbr title="the
      second">II</abbr>. The State, first in England, then in France and
      America, finds its sanction, not in religion, but in nature, in a presumed
      contract to establish it, in the necessity for mutual protection and the
      convenience of mutual assistance. It appeals to no supernatural
      commission, but exists to protect individuals in the enjoyment of those
      absolute rights which were vested in them by the immutable laws of nature.
      “The great and chief end of men uniting into commonwealths and putting
      themselves under government is the preservation of their property.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-6" id="noteref-1-6">6</a>]</p>
      <p>While the political significance of this development has often been
      described, the analogous changes in social and economic thought have
      received less attention. They were, however, momentous, and deserve
      consideration. The emergence of an objective and passionless economic
      science took place more slowly than the corresponding movement in the
      theory of the State, because the issues were less absorbing, and, while
      one marched in the high lights of the open stage, the other lurked on the
      back stairs and in the wings. It was not till a century after Machiavelli
      had emancipated the State from religion, that the doctrine of the
      self-contained department with laws of its own begins generally to be
      applied to the world of business relations, and even in the England of the
      early seventeenth century, to discuss questions of economic organization
      purely in terms of pecuniary profit and loss still wears an air of not
      quite reputable cynicism. When the sixteenth century opens, not only
      political but social theory is saturated with doctrines drawn from the
      sphere of ethics and religion, and economic phenomena are expressed in
      terms of personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> conduct,
      as naturally and inevitably as the nineteenth century expressed them in
      terms of mechanism.</p>
      <p>Not the least fundamental of divisions among theories of society is
      between those which regard the world of human affairs as self-contained,
      and those which appeal to a supernatural criterion. Modern social theory,
      like modern political theory, develops only when society is given a
      naturalistic instead of a religious explanation, and a capital fact which
      presides at the birth of both is a change in the conception held of the
      nature and functions of a Church. The crucial period is the sixteenth and
      seventeenth centuries. The most important arena (apart from Holland) is
      England, because it is in England, with its new geographical position as
      the entrepôt between Europe and America, its achievement of internal
      economic unity two centuries before France and two and a half centuries
      before Germany, its constitutional revolution, and its powerful <i
      lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> of bankers, ship-owners, and merchants, that the
      transformation of the structure of society is earliest, swiftest, and most
      complete. Its essence is the secularization of social and economic
      philosophy. The synthesis is resolved into its elements—politics,
      business, and spiritual exercises; each assumes a separate and independent
      vitality and obeys the laws of its own being. The social functions matured
      within the Church, and long identified with it, are transferred to the
      State, which in turn is idolized as the dispenser of prosperity and the
      guardian of civilization. The theory of a hierarchy of values, embracing
      all human interests and activities in a system of which the apex is
      religion, is replaced by the conception of separate and parallel
      compartments, between which a due balance should be maintained, but which
      have no vital connection with each other.</p>
      <p>The intellectual movement is, of course, very gradual, and is
      compatible with both throw-backs and precocities which seem to refute its
      general character. It is easy to detect<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> premonitions of the coming philosophy in the
      later Middle Ages, and reversions to an earlier manner at the very end of
      the seventeenth century. Oresme in the fourteenth century can anticipate
      the monetary theory associated with the name of Gresham; in the fifteenth
      century Laurentius de Rudolfis can distinguish between trade bills and
      finance bills, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antonino describe the
      significance of capital; while Baxter in 1673 can write a <i>Christian
      Directory</i> in the style of a medieval <i lang="la">Summa</i>, and
      Bunyan in 1680 can dissect the economic iniquities of Mr. Badman, who
      ground the poor with high prices and usury, in the manner of a medieval
      friar.[<a href="#footnote-1-7" id="noteref-1-7">7</a>] But the distance
      traversed in the two centuries between 1500 and 1700 is, nevertheless,
      immense. At the earlier date, though economic rationalism has proceeded
      far in Italy, the typical economic systems are those of the Schoolmen; the
      typical popular teaching is that of the sermon, or of manuals such as <i
      lang="la">Dives et Pauper</i>; the typical appeal in difficult cases of
      conscience is to the Bible, the Fathers, the canon law and its
      interpreters; the typical controversy is carried on in terms of morality
      and religion as regularly and inevitably as two centuries later it is
      conducted in terms of economic expediency.</p>
      <p>It is not necessary to point out that the age of Henry <abbr title="the
      eighth">VIII</abbr> and Thomas Cromwell had nothing to learn from the
      twentieth century as to the niceties of political intrigue or commercial
      sharp practice. But a cynical unscrupulousness in high places is not
      incompatible with a general belief in the validity of moral standards
      which are contradicted by it. No one can read the discussions which took
      place between 1500 and 1550 on three burning issues—the rise in prices,
      capital and interest, and the land question in England—without being
      struck by the constant appeal from the new and clamorous economic
      interests of the day to the traditional Christian morality, which in
      social organization, as in the relations of individuals, is still
      conceived to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
      final authority. It is because it is regarded as the final authority that
      the officers of the Church claim to be heard on questions of social
      policy, and that, however Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, and Calvinists
      may differ on doctrine or ecclesiastical government, Luther and Calvin,
      Latimer and Laud, John Knox and the Pilgrim Fathers are agreed that social
      morality is the province of the Church, and are prepared both to teach it,
      and to enforce it, when necessary, by suitable discipline.</p>
      <p>By the middle of the seventeenth century all that is altered. After the
      Restoration, we are in a new world of economic, as well as of political,
      thought. The claim of religion, at best a shadowy claim, to maintain rules
      of good conscience in economic affairs finally vanished with the
      destruction of Laud’s experiment in a confessional State, and with the
      failure of the work of the Westminster Assembly. After the Civil War, the
      attempt to maintain the theory that there was a Christian standard of
      economic conduct was impossible, not only because of lay opposition, but
      because the division of the Churches made it evident that no common
      standard existed which could be enforced by ecclesiastical machinery. The
      doctrine of the Restoration economists,[<a href="#footnote-1-8"
      id="noteref-1-8">8</a>] that, as proved by the experience of Holland,
      trade and tolerance flourished together, had its practical significance in
      the fact that neither could prosper without large concessions to
      individualism.</p>
      <p>The ground which is vacated by the Christian moralist is quickly
      occupied by theorists of another order. The future for the next two
      hundred years is not with the attempt to reaffirm, with due allowance for
      altered circumstances, the conception that a moral rule is binding on
      Christians in their economic transactions, but with the new science of
      Political Arithmetic, which asserts, at first with hesitation and then
      with confidence, that no moral rule beyond the letter of the law exists.
      Influenced in its method by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg
      11]</span> contemporary progress of mathematics and physics, it handles
      economic phenomena, not as a casuist, concerned to distinguish right from
      wrong, but as a scientist, applying a new calculus to impersonal economic
      forces. Its method, temper, and assumptions are accepted by all educated
      men, including the clergy, even though its particular conclusions continue
      for long to be disputed. Its greatest English exponent, before the days of
      Adam Smith, is the Reverend Dr. Tucker, Dean of Gloucester.</p>
      <p>Some of the particular stages in this transition will be discussed
      later. But that there was a transition, and that the intellectual and
      moral conversion which it produced was not less momentous than the effect
      of some more familiar intellectual revolutions, is undeniable. Nor is it
      to be refuted by insisting that economic motives and economic needs are as
      old as history, or that the appeal to religion is often a decorous drapery
      for a triumphant materialism. A medieval cynic, in expounding the canon
      law as to usury, remarked that “he who takes it goes to hell, and he who
      does not goes to the workhouse.”[<a href="#footnote-1-9"
      id="noteref-1-9">9</a>] Mr. Coulton does well to remind us that, even in
      the Age of Faith, resounding principles were compatible with very sordid
      practice. In a discussion which has as its subject social thought, not the
      history of business organization, it is not necessary to elaborate that
      truism. Only the credulous or the disillusioned will contrast successive
      periods as light with darkness or darkness with light, or yield to the
      temper which finds romantic virtues in every age except its own. To
      appraise the merits of different theories of social organization must be
      left to those who feel confident that they possess an adequate criterion.
      All that can be attempted in these pages is to endeavor to understand a
      few among them.</p>
      <p>For, after all, because doctrine and conduct diverge, it does not
      follow that to examine the former is to hunt abstractions. That men should
      have thought as they did is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg
      12]</span> sometimes as significant as that they should have acted as they
      did, and not least significant when thought and practice are at variance.
      It may be true that “theory is a criticism of life only in the same sense
      as a good man is a criticism of a bad one.” But the emphasis of the
      theorist on certain aspects and values is not arbitrary, but is itself an
      interpretation, and, if his answers are to be discounted, his questions
      are none the less evidence as to the assumptions of the period in which
      they were asked. It would be paradoxical to dismiss Machiavelli and Locke
      and Smith and Bentham as irrelevant to the political practice of their
      age, merely on the ground that mankind has still to wait for the ideal
      Prince or Whig or Individualist or Utilitarian. It is not less paradoxical
      to dismiss those who formulated economic and social theories in the Middle
      Ages or in the sixteenth century merely because, behind canon law and <i
      lang="la">summæ</i> and sermons, behind the good ordinances of borough and
      gild, behind statutes and proclamations and prerogative courts, there
      lurked the immutable appetites of the economic man.</p>
      <p>There is an evolution of ideas, as well as of organisms, and the
      quality of civilization depends, as Professor Wallas has so convincingly
      shown, on the transmission, less of physical qualities, than of a complex
      structure of habits, knowledge, and beliefs, the destruction of which
      would be followed within a year by the death of half the human race.
      Granted that the groundwork of inherited dispositions with which the
      individual is born has altered little in recorded history, the interests
      and values which compose his world have undergone a succession of
      revolutions. The conventional statement that human nature does not change
      is plausible only so long as attention is focused on those aspects of it
      which are least distinctively human. The wolf is today what he was when he
      was hunted by Nimrod. But, while men are born with many of the
      characteristics of wolves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg
      13]</span> man is a wolf domesticated, who both transmits the arts by
      which he has been partially tamed and improves upon them. He steps into a
      social inheritance, to which each generation adds its own contribution of
      good and evil, before it bequeaths it to its successors.</p>
      <p>There is a moral and religious, as well as a material, environment,
      which sets its stamp on the individual, even when he is least conscious of
      it. And the effect of changes in this environment is not less profound.
      The economic categories of modern society, such as property, freedom of
      contract and competition, are as much a part of its intellectual furniture
      as its political conceptions, and, together with religion, have probably
      been the most potent force in giving it its character. Between the
      conception of society as a community of unequal classes with varying
      functions, organized for a common end, and that which regards it as a
      mechanism adjusting itself through the play of economic motives to the
      supply of economic needs; between the idea that a man must not take
      advantage of his neighbor’s necessity, and the doctrine that “man’s
      self-love is God’s providence”; between the attitude which appeals to a
      religious standard to repress economic appetites, and that which regards
      expediency as the final criterion—there is a chasm which no theory of the
      permanence and ubiquity of economic interests can bridge, and which
      deserves at least to be explored. To examine how the latter grew out of
      the former; to trace the change, from a view of economic activity which
      regarded it as one among other kinds of moral conduct, to the view of it
      as dependent upon impersonal and almost automatic forces; to observe the
      struggle of individualism, in the face of restrictions imposed in the name
      of religion by the Church and of public policy by the State, first
      denounced, then palliated, then triumphantly justified in the name of
      economic liberty; to watch how ecclesiastical authority strives to
      maintain its hold upon the spheres it<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> had claimed and finally abdicates them—to do
      this is not to indulge a vain curiosity, but to stand at the sources of
      rivulets which are now a flood.</p>
      <p>Has religious opinion in the past regarded questions of social
      organization and economic conduct as irrelevant to the life of the spirit,
      or has it endeavored not only to christianize the individual but to make a
      Christian civilization? Can religion admit the existence of a sharp
      antithesis between personal morality and the practices which are
      permissible in business? Does the idea of a Church involve the acceptance
      of any particular standard of social ethics, and, if so, ought a Church to
      endeavor to enforce it as among the obligations incumbent on its members?
      Such are a few of the questions which men are asking today, and on which a
      more competent examination of history than I can hope to offer might throw
      at any rate an oblique and wavering light.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-1-1"><abbr title="1">I</abbr>. THE SOCIAL ORGANISM</h3>
      <p>We are asking these questions today. Men were asking the same
      questions, though in different language, throughout the sixteenth century.
      It is a commonplace that modern economic history begins with a series of
      revolutionary changes in the direction and organization of commerce, in
      finance, in prices, and in agriculture. To the new economic situation men
      brought a body of doctrine, law and tradition, hammered out during the
      preceding three centuries. Since the new forces were bewildering, and
      often shocking, to conservative consciences, moralists and religious
      teachers met them at first by a re-affirmation of the traditional
      doctrines, by which, it seemed, their excesses might be restrained and
      their abuses corrected. As the changed environment became, not a novelty,
      but an established fact, these doctrines had to be modified. As the
      effects of the Reformation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg
      15]</span> developed, different churches produced characteristic
      differences of social opinion.</p>
      <p>But these were later developments, which only gradually became
      apparent. The new economic world was not accepted without a struggle.
      Apart from a few extremists, the first generation of reformers were rarely
      innovators in matters of social theory, and quoted Fathers and church
      councils, decretals and canon lawyers, in complete unconsciousness that
      innovations in doctrine and church government involved any breach with
      what they had learned to regard as the moral tradition of Christendom.
      Hence the sixteenth century sees a collision, not only between different
      schools of religious thought, but between the changed economic environment
      and the accepted theory of society. To understand it, one must place
      oneself at the point from which it started. One must examine, however
      summarily, the historical background.</p>
      <p>That background consisted of the body of social theory, stated and
      implicit, which was the legacy of the Middle Ages. The formal teaching was
      derived from the Bible, the works of the Fathers and Schoolmen, the canon
      law and its commentators, and had been popularized in sermons and
      religious manuals. The informal assumptions were those implicit in law,
      custom, and social institutions. Both were complex, and to speak of them
      as a unity is to sacrifice truth to convenience. It may be that the
      political historian is justified when he covers with a single phrase the
      five centuries or more to which tradition has assigned the title of the
      Middle Ages. For the student of economic conditions that suggestion of
      homogeneity is the first illusion to be discarded.</p>
      <p>The medieval economic world was marked, it is true, by certain common
      characteristics. They sprang from the fact that on the west it was a
      closed system, that on the north it had so much elbow-room as was given by
      the Baltic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> and the rivers
      emptying themselves into it, and that on the east, where it was open, the
      apertures were concentrated along a comparatively short coast-line from
      Alexandria to the Black Sea, so that they were easily commanded by any
      naval power dominating the eastern Mediterranean, and easily cut by any
      military power which could squat across the trade routes before they
      reached the sea. While, however, these broad facts determined that the two
      main currents of trade should run from east to west and north to south,
      and that the most progressive economic life of the age should cluster in
      the regions from which these currents started and where they met, within
      this general economic framework there was the greatest variety of
      condition and development. The contours of economic civilization ran on
      different lines from those of subsequent centuries, but the contrast
      between mountain and valley was not less clearly marked. If the sites on
      which a complex economic structure rose were far removed from those of
      later generations, it flourished none the less where conditions favored
      its growth. In spite of the ubiquity of manor and gild, there was as much
      difference between the life of a center of capitalist industry, like
      fifteenth-century Flanders, or a center of capitalist finance, like
      fifteenth-century Florence, and a pastoral society exporting raw materials
      and a little food, like medieval England, as there is between modern
      Lancashire or London and modern Denmark. To draw from English conditions a
      picture of a whole world stagnating in economic squalor, or basking in
      economic innocence, is as absurd as to reconstruct the economic life of
      Europe in the twentieth century from a study of the Shetland Islands or
      the Ukraine. The elements in the social theory of the Middle Ages were
      equally various, and equally changing. Even if the student confines
      himself to the body of doctrine which is definitely associated with
      religion, and takes as typical of it the <i lang="la">Summæ</i> of the
      Schoolmen, he finds it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
      constant process of development. The economic teaching of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antonino in the fifteenth century, for example,
      was far more complex and realistic than that of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas in the thirteenth, and down to the very
      end of the Middle Ages the best-established and most characteristic parts
      of the system—for example, the theory of prices and of usury—so far from
      being stationary, were steadily modified and elaborated.</p>
      <p>There are, perhaps, four main attitudes which religious opinion may
      adopt toward the world of social institutions and economic relations. It
      may stand on one side in ascetic aloofness and regard them as in their
      very nature the sphere of unrighteousness, from which men <i>may</i>
      escape—from which, if they consider their souls, they <i>will</i>
      escape—but which they can conquer only by flight. It may take them for
      granted and ignore them, as matters of indifference belonging to a world
      with which religion has no concern; in all ages the prudence of looking
      problems boldly in the face and passing on has seemed too self-evident to
      require justification. It may throw itself into an agitation for some
      particular reform, for the removal of some crying scandal, for the
      promotion of some final revolution, which will inaugurate the reign of
      righteousness on earth. It may at once accept and criticize, tolerate and
      amend, welcome the gross world of human appetites, as the squalid
      scaffolding from amid which the life of the spirit must rise, and insist
      that this also is the material of the Kingdom of God. To such a temper,
      all activities divorced from religion are brutal or dead, but none are too
      mean to be beneath or too great to be above it, since all, in their
      different degrees, are touched with the spirit which permeates the whole.
      It finds its most sublime expression in the words of Piccarda: “Paradise
      is everywhere, though the grace of the highest good is not shed everywhere
      in the same degree.”</p>
      <p>Each of these attitudes meets us today. Each meets us<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> in the thought of the Middle
      Ages, as differences of period and place and economic environment and
      personal temperament evoke it. In the early Middle Ages the ascetic temper
      predominates. Lanfranc, for example, who sees nothing in economic life but
      the struggle of wolves over carrion, thinks that men of business can
      hardly be saved, for they live by cheating and profiteering.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-10" id="noteref-1-10">10</a>] It is monasticism, with
      its repudiation of the prizes and temptations of the secular world, which
      is <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> the life of religion. As one phase of
      it succumbed to ease and affluence, another rose to restore the primitive
      austerity, and the return to evangelical poverty, preached by <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis but abandoned by many of his followers,
      was the note of the majority of movements for reform. As for
      indifferentism—what else, for all its communistic phrases, is Wyclif’s
      teaching, that the “just man is already lord of all” and that “in this
      world God must serve the devil,” but an anticipation of the doctrine of
      celestial happiness as the compensation for earthly misery, to which
      Hobbes gave a cynical immortality when he wrote that the persecuted,
      instead of rebelling, “must expect their reward in Heaven,” and which Mr.
      and Mrs. Hammond have revealed as an opiate dulling both the pain and the
      agitation of the Industrial Revolution? If obscure sects like the Poor Men
      of Lyons are too unorthodox to be cited, the Friars are not, and it was
      not only Langland and that gentlemanly journalist, Froissart, who accused
      them—the phrase has a long history—of stirring up class hatred.</p>
      <p>To select from so immense a sea of ideas about society and religion
      only the specimens that fit the meshes of one’s own small net, and to
      label them “medieval thought,” is to beg all questions. Ideas have a
      pedigree which, if realized, would often embarrass their exponents. The
      day has long since passed when it could be suggested that only one-half of
      modern Christianity has its root in medieval religion. There is a medieval
      Puritanism and rationalism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg
      19]</span> as well as a medieval Catholicism. In the field of
      ecclesiastical theory, as Mr. Manning has pointed out in his excellent
      book,[<a href="#footnote-1-11" id="noteref-1-11">11</a>] Gregory <abbr
      title="the seventh">VII</abbr> and Boniface
      <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> have their true successors in Calvin
      and Knox. What is true of religion and political thought is equally true
      of economic and social doctrines. The social theories of Luther and
      Latimer, of Bucer and Bullinger, of sixteenth-century Anabaptists and
      seventeenth-century Levellers, of Puritans like Baxter, Anglicans like
      Laud, Baptists like Bunyan, Quakers like Bellers, are all the children of
      medieval parents. Like the Church today in regions which have not yet
      emerged from savagery, the Church of the earlier Middle Ages had been
      engaged in an immense missionary effort, in which, as it struggled with
      the surrounding barbarism, the work of conversion and of social
      construction had been almost indistinguishable. By the very nature of its
      task, as much as by the intention of its rulers, it had become the
      greatest of political institutions. For good or evil it aspired to be, not
      a sect, but a civilization, and, when its unity was shattered at the
      Reformation, the different Churches which emerged from it endeavored,
      according to their different opportunities, to perpetuate the same
      tradition. Asceticism or renunciation, quietism or indifferentism, the
      zeal which does well to be angry, the temper which seeks a synthesis of
      the external order and the religion of the spirit—all alike, in one form
      or another, are represented in the religious thought and practice of the
      Middle Ages.</p>
      <p>All are represented in it, but not all are equally representative of
      it. Of the four attitudes suggested above, it is the last which is most
      characteristic. The first fundamental assumption which is taken over by
      the sixteenth century is that the ultimate standard of human institutions
      and activities is religion. The architectonics of the system had been
      worked out in the <i lang="la">Summæ</i> of the Schoolmen. In sharp
      contrast to the modern temper, which takes the destination<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> for granted, and is thrilled
      by the hum of the engine, medieval religious thought strains every
      interest and activity, by however arbitrary a compression, into the
      service of a single idea. The lines of its scheme run up and down, and,
      since purpose is universal and all-embracing, there is, at least in
      theory, no room for eccentric bodies which move in their own private
      orbit. That purpose is set by the divine plan of the universe. “The
      perfect happiness of man cannot be other than the vision of the divine
      essence.”[<a href="#footnote-1-12" id="noteref-1-12">12</a>]</p>
      <p>Hence all activities fall within a single system, because all, though
      with different degrees of immediateness, are related to a single end, and
      derive their significance from it. The Church in its wider sense is the
      Christian Commonwealth, within which that end is to be realized; in its
      narrower sense it is the hierarchy divinely commissioned for its
      interpretation; in both it embraces the whole of life, and its authority
      is final. Though practice is perpetually at variance with theory, there is
      no absolute division between the inner and personal life, which is “the
      sphere of religion,” and the practical interests, the external order, the
      impersonal mechanism, to which, if some modern teachers may be trusted,
      religion is irrelevant.</p>
      <p>There is no absolute division, but there is a division of quality.
      There are—to use a modern phrase—degrees of reality. The distinctive
      feature of medieval thought is that contrasts which later were to be
      presented as irreconcilable antitheses appear in it as differences within
      a larger unity, and that the world of social organization, originating in
      physical necessities, passes by insensible gradations into that of the
      spirit. Man shares with other animals the necessity of maintaining and
      perpetuating his species; in addition, as a natural creature, he has what
      is peculiar to himself, an inclination to the life of the intellect and of
      society—“to know the truth about God and to live in communities.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-13" id="noteref-1-13">13</a>] These activities, which
      form his life according to the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg
      21]</span> of nature, may be regarded, and sometimes are regarded, as
      indifferent or hostile to the life of the spirit. But the characteristic
      thought is different. It is that of a synthesis.</p>
      <p>The contrast between nature and grace, between human appetites and
      interests and religion, is not absolute, but relative. It is a contrast of
      matter and the spirit informing it, of stages in a process, of preparation
      and fruition. Grace works on the unregenerate nature of man, not to
      destroy it, but to transform it. And what is true of the individual is
      true of society. An attempt is made to give it a new significance by
      relating it to the purpose of human life as known by revelation. In the
      words of a famous (or notorious) Bull: “The way of religion is to lead the
      things which are lower to the things which are higher through the things
      which are intermediate. According to the law of the universe all things
      are not reduced to order equally and immediately; but the lowest through
      the intermediate, the intermediate through the higher.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-14" id="noteref-1-14">14</a>] Thus social institutions
      assume a character which may almost be called sacramental, for they are
      the outward and imperfect expression of a supreme spiritual reality.
      Ideally conceived, society is an organism of different grades, and human
      activities form a hierarchy of functions, which differ in kind and in
      significance, but each of which is of value on its own plane, provided
      that it is governed, however remotely, by the end which is common to all.
      Like the celestial order, of which it is the dim reflection, society is
      stable, because it is straining upwards:</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Needless to say, metaphysics, however sublime, were not the daily food
      of the Middle Ages, any more than of today. The fifteenth century saw an
      outburst of commercial activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg
      22]</span> and of economic speculation, and by the middle of it all this
      teaching was becoming antiquated. Needless to say, also, general ideas
      cannot be kept in compartments, and the teleology of medieval speculation
      colored the interpretation of common affairs, as it was colored by physics
      in the eighteenth century and by the idea of evolution in the nineteenth.
      If the first legacy of the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century was the
      idea of religion as embracing all aspects of human life, the second and
      third flowed naturally from the working of that idea in the economic
      environment of the time. They may be called, respectively, the functional
      view of class organization, and the doctrine of economic ethics.</p>
      <p>From the twelfth century to the sixteenth, from the work of Beckett’s
      secretary in 1159 to the work of Henry <abbr title="the
      eighth">VIII</abbr>’s chaplain in 1537, the analogy by which society is
      described—an analogy at once fundamental and commonplace—is the same.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-15" id="noteref-1-15">15</a>] Invoked in every economic
      crisis to rebuke extortion and dissension with a high doctrine of social
      solidarity, it was not finally discarded till the rise of a theoretical
      individualism in England in the seventeenth century. It is that of the
      human body. The gross facts of the social order are accepted in all their
      harshness and brutality. They are accepted with astonishing docility, and,
      except on rare occasions, there is no question of reconstruction. What
      they include is no trifle. It is nothing less than the whole edifice of
      feudal society—class privilege, class oppression, exploitation, serfdom.
      But these things cannot, it is thought, be treated as simply alien to
      religion, for religion is all-comprehensive. They must be given some
      ethical meaning, must be shown to be the expression of some larger plan.
      The meaning given them is simple. The facts of class status and inequality
      were rationalized in the Middle Ages by a functional theory of society, as
      the facts of competition were rationalized in the eighteenth by the theory
      of economic harmonies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
      and the former took the same delight in contemplating the moral purpose
      revealed in social organization as the latter in proving that to the
      curious mechanism of human society a moral purpose was superfluous or
      disturbing. Society, like the human body, is an organism composed of
      different members. Each member has its own function, prayer, or defense,
      or merchandise, or tilling the soil. Each must receive the means suited to
      its station, and must claim no more. Within classes there must be
      equality; if one takes into his hand the living of two, his neighbor will
      go short. Between classes there must be inequality; for otherwise a class
      cannot perform its function, or—a strange thought to us—enjoy its rights.
      Peasants must not encroach on those above them. Lords must not despoil
      peasants. Craftsmen and merchants must receive what will maintain them in
      their calling, and no more.</p>
      <p>As a rule of social policy, the doctrine was at once repressive and
      protective. “There is degree above degree, as reason is, and skill it is
      that men do their devoir thereas it is due. But certes, extortions and
      despite of your underlings is damnable.”[<a href="#footnote-1-16"
      id="noteref-1-16">16</a>] As a philosophy of society, it attempted to
      spiritualize the material by incorporating it in a divine universe, which
      should absorb and transform it. To that process of transmutation the life
      of mere money-making was recalcitrant, and hence, indeed, the stigma
      attached to it. For, in spite of the ingenuity of theorists, finance and
      trade, the essense of which seemed to be, not service, but a mere <i
      lang="la">appetitus divitiarum infinitus</i>, were not easily interpreted
      in terms of social function. Comparatively late intruders in a world
      dominated by conceptions hammered out in a pre-commercial age, they were
      never fitted harmoniously into the medieval synthesis, and ultimately,
      when they grew to their full stature, were to contribute to its overthrow.
      But the property of the feudal lord, the labor of the peasant or the
      craftsman, even the ferocity of the warrior,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> were not dismissed as hostile or indifferent
      to the life of the spirit. Touched by the spear of Ithuriel, they were to
      be sublimated into service, vocation and chivalry, and the ritual which
      surrounded them was designed to emphasize that they had undergone a
      re-dedication at the hands of religion. Baptized by the Church, privilege
      and power became office and duty.</p>
      <p>That the reconciliation was superficial, and that in attempting it the
      Church often degraded itself without raising the world, is as indisputable
      as that its tendency was to dignify material interests, by stamping them
      with the impress of a universal design. Gentlemen took hard tallages and
      oppressed the poor; but it was something that they should be told that
      their true function was “to defend God’s law by power of the world.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-17" id="noteref-1-17">17</a>] Craftsmen—the burden of
      endless sermons—worked deceitfully; but it was perhaps not wholly without
      value that they should pay even lip-service to the ideal of so conducting
      their trade, that the common people should not be defrauded by the evil
      ingenuity of those exercising the craft. If lord and peasant, merchant and
      artisan, burgess and villager, pressed each other hard, was it meaningless
      to meet their struggles with an assertion of universal solidarity, to
      which economic convenience and economic power must alike give way? “The
      health of the whole commonwealth will be assured and vigorous, if the
      higher members consider the lower and the lower answer in like manner the
      higher, so that each is in its turn a member of every other.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-18" id="noteref-1-18">18</a>]</p>
      <p>If the medieval moralist was often too naïve in expecting sound
      practice as the result of lofty principles alone, he was at least free
      from that not unfashionable form of credulity which expects it from their
      absence or from their opposite. To say that the men to whom such teaching
      was addressed went out to rob and cheat is to say no more than that they
      were men. Nor is it self-evident that they would have been<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> more likely to be honest, if
      they had been informed, like some of their descendants, that competition
      was designed by Providence to provide an automatic substitute for honesty.
      Society was interpreted, in short, not as the expression of economic
      self-interest, but as held together by a system of mutual, though varying,
      obligations. Social well-being exists, it was thought, in so far as each
      class performs its functions and enjoys the rights proportioned thereto.
      “The Church is divided in these three parts, preachers, and defenders, and
      ... laborers.... As she is our mother, so she is a body, and health of
      this body stands in this, that one part of her answer to another, after
      the same measure that Jesus Christ has ordained it.... Kindly man’s hand
      helps his head, and his eye helps his foot, and his foot his body ... and
      thus should it be in parts of the Church.... As divers parts of man served
      unkindly to man if one took the service of another and left his own proper
      work, so divers parts of the Church have proper works to serve God; and if
      one part leave his work that God has limited him and take work of another
      part, sinful wonder is in the Church.... Surely the Church shall never be
      whole before proportions of her parts be brought again by this heavenly
      leech and [by] medicine of men.”[<a href="#footnote-1-19"
      id="noteref-1-19">19</a>]</p>
      <p>Speculation does not develop <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>. It echoes,
      however radical it is, the established order. Clearly this patriarchal
      doctrine is a softened reflection of the feudal land system. Not less
      clearly the Church’s doctrine of economic ethics is the expression of the
      conditions of medieval industry. A religious philosophy, unless it is
      frankly to abandon nine-tenths of conduct to the powers of darkness,
      cannot admit the doctrine of a world of business and economic relations
      self-sufficient and divorced from ethics and religion. But the facts may
      be difficult to moralize, or they may be relatively easy. Over a great
      part of Europe in the later Middle Ages, the economic environment was less
      intractable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> than it had
      been in the days of the Empire or than it is today. In the great
      commercial centers there was sometimes, it is true, a capitalism as
      inhuman as any which the world has seen, and from time to time ferocious
      class wars between artisans and merchants.[<a href="#footnote-1-20"
      id="noteref-1-20">20</a>] But outside them trade, industry, the
      money-market, all that we call the economic system, was not a system, but
      a mass of individual trades and individual dealings. Pecuniary
      transactions were a fringe on a world of natural economy. There was little
      mobility or competition. There was very little large-scale organization.
      With some important exceptions, such as the textile workers of Flanders
      and Italy, who, in the fourteenth century, again and again rose in revolt,
      the medieval artisan, especially in backward countries like England, was a
      small master. The formation of temporary organizations, or “parliaments,”
      of wage-earners, which goes on in London even before the end of the
      thirteenth century,[<a href="#footnote-1-21" id="noteref-1-21">21</a>] and
      the growth of journeymen’s associations in the later Middle Ages, are a
      proof that the conditions which produced modern trade unionism were not
      unknown. But even in a great city like Paris the 128 gilds which existed
      at the end of the thirteenth century appear to have included 5,000
      masters, who employed not more than 6,000 to 7,000 journeymen. At
      Frankfurt-am-Main in 1387 actually not more than 750 to 800 journeymen are
      estimated to have been in the service of 1,554 masters.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-22" id="noteref-1-22">22</a>]</p>
      <p>In cities of this kind, with their freedom, their comparative peace,
      and their strong corporate feeling, large enough to be prolific of
      associations and small enough for each man to know his neighbor, an ethic
      of mutual aid was not wholly impossible, and it is in the light of such
      conditions that the most characteristic of medieval industrial
      institutions is to be interpreted. To suggest that anything like a
      majority of medieval workers were ever members of a craft gild is
      extravagant. In England, at any rate, more<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> than nine-tenths were peasants, among whom,
      though friendly societies called gilds were common, there was naturally no
      question of craft organization. Even in the towns it is a question whether
      there was not a considerable population of casual workers—consider only
      the number of unskilled workers that must have been required as laborers
      by the craftsmen building a cathedral in the days before mechanical
      cranes—who were rarely organized in permanent societies. To invest the
      craft gilds with a halo of economic chivalry is not less inappropriate.
      They were, first and foremost, monopolists, and the cases in which their
      vested interests came into collision with the consumer were not a few.
      Wyclif, with his almost modern devotion to the conception of a unitary
      society over-riding particular interests for the common good, was
      naturally prejudiced against corporations, on the ground that they
      distracted social unity by the intrusion of sectarian cupidities and
      sinister ambitions; but there was probably from time to time more than a
      little justification for his complaint that “all new fraternities or gilds
      made of men seem openly to run in this curse [against false
      conspirators],” because “they conspire to bear up each other, yea, in
      wrong, and oppress other men in their right by their wit and power.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-23" id="noteref-1-23">23</a>] It is significant that the
      most striking of the projects of political and social reconstruction
      produced in Germany in the century before the Reformation proposed the
      complete abolition of gilds, as intolerably corrupt and tyrannical.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-24" id="noteref-1-24">24</a>]</p>
      <p>There are, however, monopolists and monopolists. An age in which
      combinations are not tempted to pay lip-service to religion may do well to
      remember that the characteristic, after all, of the medieval gild was
      that, if it sprang from economic needs, it claimed, at least, to
      subordinate them to social interests, as conceived by men for whom the
      social and the spiritual were inextricably intertwined. “Tout ce petit
      monde antique,” writes the historian of French gilds,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> “était fortement imbu des idées chrétiennes
      sur le juste salaire et le juste prix; sans doute il y avait alors, comme
      aujourd’hui, des cupidités et des convoitises; mais une règle puissante
      s’imposait à tous et d’une manière générale exigeait pour chacun le pain
      quotidien promis par l’Evangile.”[<a href="#footnote-1-25"
      id="noteref-1-25">25</a>] The attempt to preserve a rough equality among
      “the good men of the mistery,” to check economic egotism by insisting that
      every brother shall share his good fortune with another and stand by his
      neighbor in need, to resist the encroachments of a conscienceless
      money-power, to preserve professional standards of training and
      craftsmanship, and to repress by a strict corporate discipline the natural
      appetite of each to snatch special advantages for himself to the injury of
      all—whether these things outweigh the evils of conservative methods and
      corporate exclusiveness is a question which each student will answer in
      accordance with his own predilections. What is clear, at least, is that
      both the rules of fraternities and the economic teaching of the Church
      were prompted by the problems of a common environment. Much that is now
      mechanical was then personal, intimate and direct, and there was little
      room for organization on a scale too vast for the standards that are
      applied to individuals, or for the doctrine which silences scruples and
      closes all accounts with the final plea of economic expediency.</p>
      <p>Such an environment, with its personal economic relations, was a not
      unfavorable field for a system of social ethics. And the Church, which
      brought to its task the tremendous claim to mediate between even the
      humblest activity and the divine purpose, sought to supply it. True, its
      teaching was violated in practice, and violated grossly, in the very
      citadel of Christendom which promulgated it. Contemporaries were under no
      illusion as to the reality of economic motives in the Age of Faith. They
      had only to look at Rome. From the middle of the thirteenth century a<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> continuous wail arises against
      the iniquity of the Church, and its burden may be summed up in one word,
      “avarice.” At Rome, everything is for sale. What is reverenced is the
      gospel, not according to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
      Mark, but according to the marks of silver.[<a href="#footnote-1-26"

      <p>The Papacy might denounce usurers, but, as the center of the most
      highly organized administrative system of the age, receiving remittances
      from all over Europe, and receiving them in money at a time when the
      revenue of other Governments still included personal services and payments
      in kind, it could not dispense with them. Dante put the Cahorsine
      money-lenders in hell, but a Pope gave them the title of “peculiar sons of
      the Roman Church.”[<a href="#footnote-1-28" id="noteref-1-28">28</a>]
      Grosstête rebuked the Lombard bankers, and a bishop of London expelled
      them, but papal protection brought them back.[<a href="#footnote-1-29"
      id="noteref-1-29">29</a>] Archbishop Peckham, a few years later, had to
      implore Pope Nicholas <abbr title="the third">III</abbr> to withdraw a
      threat of excommunication, intended to compel him to pay the usurious
      interest demanded by Italian money-lenders, though, as the archbishop
      justly observed, “by your Holiness’s special mandate, it would be my duty
      to take strong measures against such lenders.”[<a href="#footnote-1-30"
      id="noteref-1-30">30</a>] The Papacy was, in a sense, the greatest
      financial institution of the Middle Ages, and, as its fiscal system was
      elaborated, things became, not better, but worse. The abuses which were a
      trickle in the thirteenth century were a torrent in the fifteenth. And the
      frailties of Rome, if exceptional in their notoriety, can hardly be
      regarded as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> unique.
      Priests, it is from time to time complained, engage in trade and take
      usury.[<a href="#footnote-1-31" id="noteref-1-31">31</a>] Cathedral
      chapters lend money at high rates of interest. The profits of usury, like
      those of simony, should have been refused by churchmen, as hateful to God;
      but a bishop of Paris, when consulted by a usurer as to the salvation of
      his soul, instead of urging restitution, recommended him to dedicate his
      ill-gotten wealth to the building of Notre-Dame.[<a href="#footnote-1-32"
      id="noteref-1-32">32</a>] “Thus,” exclaimed <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
      Bernard, as he gazed at the glories of Gothic architecture, “wealth is
      drawn up by ropes of wealth, thus money bringeth money.... O vanity of
      vanities, yet no more vain than insane! The Church is resplendent in her
      walls, beggarly in her poor. She clothes her stones in gold, and leaves
      her sons naked.”[<a href="#footnote-1-33" id="noteref-1-33">33</a>]</p>
      <p>The picture is horrifying, and one must be grateful to those, like
      <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr>
      Luchaire and Mr. Coulton, who demolish romance. But the denunciation of
      vices implies that they are recognized as vicious; to ignore their
      condemnation is not less one-sided than to conceal their existence; and,
      when the halo has vanished from practice, it remains to ask what
      principles men valued, and what standards they erected. The economic
      doctrines elaborated in the <i lang="la">Summæ</i> of the Schoolmen, in
      which that question receives its most systematic answer, have not
      infrequently been dismissed as the fanciful extravagances of writers
      disqualified from throwing light on the affairs of this world by their
      morbid preoccupation with those of the next. In reality, whatever may be
      thought of their conclusions, both the occasion and the purpose of
      scholastic speculations upon economic questions were eminently practical.
      The movement which prompted them was the growth of trade, of town life,
      and of a commercial economy, in a world whose social categories were still
      those of the self-sufficing village and the feudal hierarchy. The object
      of their authors was to solve the problems to which such developments gave
      rise. It was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> reconcile
      the new contractual relations, which sprang from economic expansion, with
      the traditional morality expounded by the Church. Viewed by posterity as
      reactionaries, who damned the currents of economic enterprise with an
      irrelevant appeal to Scripture and to the Fathers, in their own age they
      were the pioneers of a liberal intellectual movement. By lifting the
      weight of antiquated formulæ they cleared a space within the stiff
      framework of religious authority for new and mobile economic interests,
      and thus supplied an intellectual justification for developments which
      earlier generations would have condemned.</p>
      <p>The mercantilist thought of later centuries owed a considerable debt to
      scholastic discussions of money, prices, and interest. But the specific
      contributions of medieval writers to the technique of economic theory were
      less significant than their premises. Their fundamental assumptions, both
      of which were to leave a deep imprint on the social thought of the
      sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were two: that economic interests are
      subordinate to the real business of life, which is salvation, and that
      economic conduct is one aspect of personal conduct, upon which, as on
      other parts of it, the rules of morality are binding. Material riches are
      necessary; they have a secondary importance, since without them men cannot
      support themselves and help one another; the wise ruler, as <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas said,[<a href="#footnote-1-34"
      id="noteref-1-34">34</a>] will consider in founding his State the natural
      resources of the country. But economic motives are suspect. Because they
      are powerful appetites, men fear them, but they are not mean enough to
      applaud them. Like other strong passions, what they need, it is thought,
      is not a clear field, but repression. There is no place in medieval theory
      for economic activity which is not related to a moral end, and to found a
      science of society upon the assumption that the appetite for economic gain
      is a constant and measurable force, to be accepted, like other natural
      forces, as an inevitable and self-evident <i lang="la">datum</i>,<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> would have appeared to the
      medieval thinker as hardly less irrational or less immoral than to make
      the premise of social philosophy the unrestrained operation of such
      necessary human attributes as pugnacity or the sexual instinct. The outer
      is ordained for the sake of the inner; economic goods are instrumental—<i
      lang="la">sicut quædam adminicula, quibus adjuvamur ad tendendum in
      beatitudinem</i>. “It is lawful to desire temporal blessings, not putting
      them in the first place, as though setting up our rest in them, but
      regarding them as aids to blessedness, inasmuch as they support our
      corporal life and serve as instruments for acts of virtue.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-35" id="noteref-1-35">35</a>] Riches, as <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antonino says, exist for man, not man for
      riches.</p>
      <p>At every turn, therefore, there are limits, restrictions, warnings
      against allowing economic interests to interfere with serious affairs. It
      is right for a man to seek such wealth as is necessary for a livelihood in
      his station. To seek more is not enterprise, but avarice, and avarice is a
      deadly sin. Trade is legitimate; the different resources of different
      countries show that it was intended by Providence. But it is a dangerous
      business. A man must be sure that he carries it on for the public benefit,
      and that the profits which he takes are no more than the wages of his
      labor. Private property is a necessary institution, at least in a fallen
      world; men work more and dispute less when goods are private than when
      they are common. But it is to be tolerated as a concession to human
      frailty, not applauded as desirable in itself; the ideal—if only man’s
      nature could rise to it—is communism. “Communis enim,” wrote Gratian in
      his <i lang="la">decretum</i>, “usus omnium, quae sunt in hoc mundo,
      omnibus hominibus esse debuit.”[<a href="#footnote-1-36"
      id="noteref-1-36">36</a>] At best, indeed, the estate is somewhat
      encumbered. It must be legitimately acquired. It must be in the largest
      possible number of hands. It must provide for the support of the poor. Its
      use must as far as practicable be common. Its owners must be ready<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> to share it with those who
      need, even if they are not in actual destitution. Such were the conditions
      which commended themselves to an archbishop of the business capital of
      fifteenth-century Europe.[<a href="#footnote-1-37"
      id="noteref-1-37">37</a>] There have been ages in which they would have
      been described, not as a justification of property, but as a revolutionary
      assault on it. For to defend the property of the peasant and small master
      is necessarily to attack that of the monopolist and usurer, which grows by
      devouring it.</p>
      <p>The assumption on which all this body of doctrine rested was simple. It
      was that the danger of economic interests increased in direct proportion
      to the prominence of the pecuniary motives associated with them. Labor—the
      common lot of mankind—is necessary and honorable; trade is necessary, but
      perilous to the soul; finance, if not immoral, is at best sordid and at
      worst disreputable. This curious inversion of the social values of more
      enlightened ages is best revealed in medieval discussions of the ethics of
      commerce. The severely qualified tolerance extended to the trader was
      partly, no doubt, a literary convention derived from classical models; it
      was natural that Aquinas should laud the State which had small need of
      merchants because it could meet its needs from the produce of its own
      soil; had not the Philosopher himself praised <i lang="el">αὐτάρκεια</i>?
      But it was a convention which coincided with a vital element in medieval
      social theory, and struck a responsive note in wide sections of medieval
      society. It is not disputed, of course, that trade is indispensable; the
      merchant supplements the deficiencies of one country with the abundance of
      another. If there were no private traders, argued Duns Scotus, whose
      indulgence was less carefully guarded, the governor would have to engage
      them. Their profits, therefore, are legitimate, and they may include, not
      only the livelihood appropriate to the trader’s status, but payment for
      labor, skill, and risk.[<a href="#footnote-1-38"
      id="noteref-1-38">38</a>]</p>
      <p>The defence, if adequate, was somewhat embarrassing.<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> For why should a defence be
      required? The insistence that trade is not positively sinful conveys a
      hint that the practices of traders may be, at least, of dubious propriety.
      And so, in the eyes of most medieval thinkers, they are. <i
      lang="la">Summe periculosa est venditionis et emptionis negotiatio.</i>[<a
      href="#footnote-1-39" id="noteref-1-39">39</a>] The explanation of that
      attitude lay partly in the facts of contemporary economic organization.
      The economy of the medieval borough—consider only its treatment of food
      supplies and prices—was one in which consumption held somewhat the same
      primacy in the public mind, as the undisputed arbiter of economic effort,
      as the nineteenth century attached to profits. The merchant pure and
      simple, though convenient to the Crown, for whom he collected taxes and
      provided loans, and to great establishments such as monasteries, whose
      wool he bought in bulk, enjoyed the double unpopularity of an alien and a
      parasite. The best practical commentary on the tepid indulgence extended
      by theorists to the trader is the network of restrictions with which
      medieval policy surrounded his activities, the recurrent storms of public
      indignation against him, and the ruthlessness with which boroughs
      suppressed the middleman who intervened between consumer and producer.</p>
      <p>Apart, however, from the color which it took from its environment,
      medieval social theory had reasons of its own for holding that business,
      as distinct from labor, required some special justification. The suspicion
      of economic motives had been one of the earliest elements in the social
      teaching of the Church, and was to survive till Calvinism endowed the life
      of economic enterprise with a new sanctification. In medieval philosophy
      the ascetic tradition, which condemned all commerce as the sphere of
      iniquity, was softened by a recognition of practical necessities, but it
      was not obliterated; and, if reluctant to condemn, it was insistent to
      warn. For it was of the essence of trade to drag into a position of
      solitary prominence the acquisitive appetites; and<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> towards those appetites, which to most modern
      thinkers have seemed the one sure social dynamic, the attitude of the
      medieval theorist was that of one who holds a wolf by the ears. The
      craftsman labors for his living; he seeks what is sufficient to support
      him, and no more. The merchant aims, not merely at livelihood, but at
      profit. The traditional distinction was expressed in the words of Gratian:
      “Whosoever buys a thing, not that he may sell it whole and unchanged, but
      that it may be a material for fashioning something, he is no merchant. But
      the man who buys it in order that he may gain by selling it again
      unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who
      are cast forth from God’s temple.”[<a href="#footnote-1-40"
      id="noteref-1-40">40</a>] By very definition a man who “buys in order that
      he may sell dearer,” the trader is moved by an inhuman concentration on
      his own pecuniary interest, unsoftened by any tincture of public spirit or
      private charity. He turns what should be a means into an end, and his
      occupation, therefore, “is justly condemned, since, regarded in itself, it
      serves the lust of gain.”[<a href="#footnote-1-41"
      id="noteref-1-41">41</a>]</p>
      <p>The dilemma presented by a form of enterprise at once perilous to the
      soul and essential to society was revealed in the solution most commonly
      propounded for it. It was to treat profits as a particular case of wages,
      with the qualification that gains in excess of a reasonable remuneration
      for the merchant’s labor were, though not illegal, reprehensible as <i
      lang="la">turpe lucrum</i>. The condition of the trader’s exoneration is
      that “he seeks gain, not as an end, but as the wages of his labor.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-42" id="noteref-1-42">42</a>] Theoretically convenient,
      the doctrine was difficult of application, for evidently it implied the
      acceptance of what the sedate irony of Adam Smith was later to describe as
      “an affectation not very common among merchants.” But the motives which
      prompted it were characteristic. The medieval theorist condemned as a sin
      precisely that effort to achieve a continuous and unlimited increase<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> in material wealth which
      modern societies applaud as a quality, and the vices for which he reserved
      his most merciless denunciations were the more refined and subtle of the
      economic virtues. “He who has enough to satisfy his wants,” wrote a
      Schoolman of the fourteenth century, “and nevertheless ceaselessly labors
      to acquire riches, either in order to obtain a higher social position, or
      that subsequently he may have enough to live without labor, or that his
      sons may become men of wealth and importance—all such are incited by a
      damnable avarice, sensuality, or pride.”[<a href="#footnote-1-43"
      id="noteref-1-43">43</a>] Two and a half centuries later, in the midst of
      a revolution in the economic and spiritual environment, Luther, in even
      more unmeasured language, was to say the same.[<a href="#footnote-1-44"
      id="noteref-1-44">44</a>] The essence of the argument was that payment may
      properly be demanded by the craftsmen who make the goods, or by the
      merchants who transport them, for both labor in their vocation and serve
      the common need. The unpardonable sin is that of the speculator or the
      middleman, who snatches private gain by the exploitation of public
      necessities. The true descendant of the doctrines of Aquinas is the labor
      theory of value. The last of the Schoolmen was Karl Marx.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-1-2"><abbr title="2">II</abbr>. THE SIN OF AVARICE</h3>
      <p>If such ideas were to be more than generalities, they required to be
      translated into terms of the particular transactions by which trade is
      conducted and property acquired. Their practical expression was the body
      of economic casuistry, in which the best-known elements are the teaching
      with regard to the just price and the prohibition of usury. These
      doctrines sprang as much from the popular consciousness of the plain facts
      of the economic situation as from the theorists who expounded them. The
      innumerable fables of the usurer who was prematurely carried to hell, or
      whose money turned to withered leaves in his strong box,<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> or who (as the scrupulous
      recorder remarks), “about the year 1240,” on entering a church to be
      married, was crushed by a stone figure falling from the porch, which
      proved by the grace of God to be a carving of another usurer and his
      money-bags being carried off by the devil, are more illuminating than the
      refinements of lawyers.[<a href="#footnote-1-45"
      id="noteref-1-45">45</a>]</p>
      <p>On these matters, as the practice of borough and manor, as well as of
      national governments, shows, the Church was preaching to the converted,
      and to dismiss its teaching on economic ethics as the pious rhetoric of
      professional moralists is to ignore the fact that precisely similar ideas
      were accepted in circles which could not be suspected of any unnatural
      squeamishness as to the arts by which men grow rich. The best commentary
      on ecclesiastical doctrines as to usury and prices is the secular
      legislation on similar subjects, for, down at least to the middle of the
      sixteenth century, their leading ideas were reflected in it. Plain men
      might curse the chicanery of ecclesiastical lawyers, and gilds and
      boroughs might forbid their members to plead before ecclesiastical courts;
      but the rules which they themselves made for the conduct of business had
      more than a flavor of the canon law. Florence was the financial capital of
      medieval Europe; but even at Florence the secular authorities fined
      bankers right and left for usury in the middle of the fourteenth century,
      and, fifty years later, first prohibited credit transactions altogether,
      and then imported Jews to conduct a business forbidden to Christians.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-46" id="noteref-1-46">46</a>] Cologne was one of the
      greatest of commercial entrepôts; but, when its successful business man
      came to make his will, he remembered that trade was perilous to the soul
      and avarice a deadly sin, and offered what atonement he could by directing
      his sons to make restitution and to follow some less dangerous occupation
      than that of the merchant.[<a href="#footnote-1-47"
      id="noteref-1-47">47</a>] The burgesses of Coventry fought the Prior over
      a question of common rights for the best part of a century; but the Court
      Leet of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> thriving
      business city put usury on a par with adultery and fornication, and
      decreed that no usurer could become mayor, councillor, or master of the
      gild.[<a href="#footnote-1-48" id="noteref-1-48">48</a>] It was not that
      laymen were unnaturally righteous; it was not that the Church was
      all-powerful, though its teaching wound into men’s minds through a hundred
      channels, and survived as a sentiment long after it was repudiated as a
      command. It was that the facts of the economic situation imposed
      themselves irresistibly on both. In reality, there was no sharp collision
      between the doctrine of the Church and the public policy of the world of
      business—its individual practice was, of course, another matter—because
      both were formed by the same environment, and accepted the same broad
      assumptions as to social expediency.</p>
      <p>The economic background of it all was very simple. The medieval
      consumer—we can sympathize with him today more easily than in 1914—is like
      a traveller condemned to spend his life at a station hotel. He occupies a
      tied house and is at the mercy of the local baker and brewer. Monopoly is
      inevitable. Indeed, a great part of medieval industry is a system of
      organized monopolies, endowed with a public status, which must be watched
      with jealous eyes to see that they do not abuse their powers. It is a
      society of small masters and peasant farmers. Wages are not a burning
      question, for, except in the great industrial centers of Italy and
      Flanders, the permanent wage-earning class is small. Usury is, as it is
      today in similar circumstances. For loans are made largely for
      consumption, not for production. The farmer whose harvest fails or whose
      beasts die, or the artisan who loses money, must have credit, seed-corn,
      cattle, raw materials, and his distress is the money-lender’s opportunity.
      Naturally, there is a passionate popular sentiment against the engrosser
      who holds a town to ransom, the monopolist who brings the livings of many
      into the hands of one, the money-lender who takes advantage<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> of his neighbor’s necessities
      to get a lien on their land and foreclose. “The usurer would not loan to
      men these goods, but if he hoped winning, that he loves more than charity.
      Many other sins be more than this usury, but for this men curse and hate
      it more than other sin.”[<a href="#footnote-1-49"
      id="noteref-1-49">49</a>]</p>
      <p>No one who examines the cases actually heard by the courts in the later
      Middle Ages will think that resentment surprising, for they throw a lurid
      light on the possibilities of commercial immorality.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-50" id="noteref-1-50">50</a>] Among the peasants and
      small masters who composed the mass of the population in medieval England,
      borrowing and lending were common, and it was with reference to their
      petty transactions, not to the world of high finance, that the traditional
      attitude towards the money-lender had been crystallized. It was natural
      that “Juetta [who] is a usuress and sells at a dearer rate for
      accommodation,” and John the Chaplain, <i lang="la">qui est usurarius
      maximus</i>,[<a href="#footnote-1-51" id="noteref-1-51">51</a>] should be
      regarded as figures at once too scandalous to be tolerated by their
      neighbors and too convenient to be altogether suppressed. The Church
      accepts this popular sentiment, gives it a religious significance, and
      crystallizes it in a system, in which economic morality is preached from
      the pulpit, emphasized in the confessional, and enforced, in the last
      resource, through the courts.</p>
      <p>The philosophical basis of it is the conception of natural law. “Every
      law framed by man bears the character of a law exactly to that extent to
      which it is derived from the law of nature. But if on any point it is in
      conflict with the law of nature, it at once ceases to be a law; it is a
      mere perversion of law.”[<a href="#footnote-1-52"
      id="noteref-1-52">52</a>] The plausible doctrine of compensations, of the
      long run, of the self-correcting mechanism, has not yet been invented. The
      idea of a law of nature—of natural justice which ought to find expression
      in positive law, but which is not exhausted in it—supplies an ideal
      standard by which the equity of particular relations can be measured. The
      most fundamental difference between medieval and<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> modern economic thought consists, indeed, in
      the fact that, whereas the latter normally refers to economic expediency,
      however it may be interpreted, for the justification of any particular
      action, policy, or system of organization, the former starts from the
      position that there is a moral authority to which considerations of
      economic expediency must be subordinated. The practical application of
      this conception is the attempt to try every transaction by a rule of
      right, which is largely, though not wholly, independent of the fortuitous
      combinations of economic circumstances. No man must ask more than the
      price fixed, either by public authorities, or, failing that, by common
      estimation. True, prices even so will vary with scarcity; for, with all
      their rigor, theologians are not so impracticable as to rule out the
      effect of changing supplies. But they will not vary with individual
      necessity or individual opportunity. The bugbear is the man who uses, or
      even creates, a temporary shortage, the man who makes money out of the
      turn of the market, the man who, as Wyclif says, <i>must</i> be wicked, or
      he could not have been poor yesterday and rich today.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-53" id="noteref-1-53">53</a>]</p>
      <p>The formal theory of the just price went, it is true, through a
      considerable development. The dominant conception of Aquinas—that prices,
      though they will vary with the varying conditions of different markets,
      should correspond with the labor and costs of the producer, as the proper
      basis of the <i lang="la">communis estimatio</i>, conformity with which
      was the safeguard against extortion—was qualified by subsequent writers.
      Several Schoolmen of the fourteenth century emphasized the subjective
      element in the common estimation, insisted that the essence of value was
      utility, and drew the conclusion that a fair price was most likely to be
      reached under freedom of contract, since the mere fact that a bargain had
      been struck showed that both parties were satisfied.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-54" id="noteref-1-54">54</a>] In the fifteenth century
      <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antonino, who wrote with a highly developed
      commercial civilization beneath his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg
      41]</span> eyes, endeavored to effect a synthesis, in which the principle
      of the traditional doctrine should be observed, while the necessary play
      should be left to economic motives. After a subtle analysis of the
      conditions affecting value, he concluded that the fairness of a price
      could at best be a matter only of “probability and conjecture,” since it
      would vary with places, periods and persons. His practical contribution
      was to introduce a new elasticity into the whole conception by
      distinguishing three grades of prices—a <i lang="la">gradus pius</i>, <i
      lang="la">discretus</i>, and <i lang="la">rigidus</i>. A seller who
      exceeded the price fixed by more than 50 per cent. was bound, he argued,
      to make restitution, and even a smaller departure from it, if deliberate,
      required atonement in the shape of alms. But accidental lapses were
      venial, and there was a debatable ground within which prices might move
      without involving sin.[<a href="#footnote-1-55"
      id="noteref-1-55">55</a>]</p>
      <p>This conclusion, with its recognition of the impersonal forces of the
      market, was the natural outcome of the intense economic activity of the
      later Middle Ages, and evidently contained the seeds of an intellectual
      revolution. The fact that it should have begun to be expounded as early as
      the middle of the fourteenth century is a reminder that the economic
      thought of Schoolmen contained elements much more various and much more
      modern than is sometimes suggested. But the characteristic doctrine was
      different. It was that which insisted on the just price as the safeguard
      against extortion. “To leave the prices of goods at the discretion of the
      sellers is to give rein to the cupidity which goads almost all of them to
      seek excessive gain.” Prices must be such, and no more than such, as will
      enable each man to “have the necessaries of life suitable for his
      station.” The most desirable course is that they should be fixed by public
      officials, after making an enquiry into the supplies available and framing
      an estimate of the requirements of different classes. Failing that, the
      individual must fix prices for himself, guided by a consideration of “what
      he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> must charge in order
      to maintain his position, and nourish himself suitably in it, and by a
      reasonable estimate of his expenditure and labor.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-56" id="noteref-1-56">56</a>] If the latter
      recommendation was a counsel of perfection, the former was almost a
      platitude. It was no more than an energetic mayor would carry out before
      breakfast.</p>
      <p>No man, again, may charge money for a loan. He may, of course, take the
      profits of partnership, provided that he takes the partner’s risks. He may
      buy a rent-charge; for the fruits of the earth are produced by nature, not
      wrung from man. He may demand compensation—<i lang="fr">interesse</i>—if
      he is not repaid the principal at the time stipulated. He may ask payment
      corresponding to any loss he incurs or gain he foregoes. He may purchase
      an annuity, for the payment is contingent and speculative, not certain. It
      is no usury when John Deveneys, who has borrowed £19 16s., binds himself
      to pay a penalty of £40 in the event of failure to restore the principal,
      for this is compensation for damages incurred; or when Geoffrey de Eston
      grants William de Burwode three marks of silver in return for an annual
      rent of six shillings, for this is the purchase of a rent-charge, not a
      loan; or when James le Reve of London advances £100 to Robert de Bree of
      Dublin, merchant, with which to trade for two years in Ireland, for this
      is a partnership; or when the priory of Worcester sells annuities for a
      capital sum paid down.[<a href="#footnote-1-57" id="noteref-1-57">57</a>]
      What remained to the end unlawful was that which appears in modern
      economic text-books as “pure interest”—interest as a fixed payment
      stipulated in advance for a loan of money or wares without risk to the
      lender. “Usura est ex mutuo lucrum pacto debitum vel exactum ... quidquid
      sorti accedit, subaudi per pactum vel exactionem, usura est, quodcunque
      nomen sibi imponat.”[<a href="#footnote-1-58" id="noteref-1-58">58</a>]
      The emphasis was on <i lang="la">pactum</i>. The essence of usury was that
      it was certain, and that, whether the borrower gained or lost, the usurer
      took his pound of flesh. Medieval opinion,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> which has no objection to rent or profits,
      provided that they are reasonable—for is not every one in a small way a
      profit-maker?—has no mercy for the debenture-holder. His crime is that he
      takes a payment for money which is fixed and certain, and such a payment
      is usury.</p>
      <p>The doctrine was, of course, more complex and more subtle than a bald
      summary suggests. With the growth of the habit of investment, of a market
      for capital, and of new forms of economic enterprise such as insurance and
      exchange business, theory became steadily more elaborate, and schools more
      sharply divided. The precise meaning and scope of the indulgence extended
      to the purchase of rent-charges produced one controversy, the foreign
      exchanges another, the development of <i lang="fr">Monts de Piété</i> a
      third. Even before the end of the fourteenth century there had been
      writers who argued that interest was the remuneration of the services
      rendered by the lender, and who pointed out (though apparently they did
      not draw the modern corollary) that present are more valuable than future
      goods.[<a href="#footnote-1-59" id="noteref-1-59">59</a>] But on the
      iniquity of payment merely for the act of lending, theological opinion,
      whether liberal or conservative, was unanimous, and its modern
      interpreter,[<a href="#footnote-1-60" id="noteref-1-60">60</a>] who sees
      in its indulgence to <i lang="fr">interesse</i> the condonation of
      interest, would have created a scandal in theological circles in any age
      before that of Calvin. To take usury is contrary to Scripture; it is
      contrary to Aristotle; it is contrary to nature, for it is to live without
      labor; it is to sell time, which belongs to God, for the advantage of
      wicked men; it is to rob those who use the money lent, and to whom, since
      they make it profitable, the profits should belong; it is unjust in
      itself, for the benefit of the loan to the borrower cannot exceed the
      value of the principal sum lent him; it is in defiance of sound juristic
      principles, for when a loan of money is made, the property in the thing
      lent passes to the borrower, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg
      44]</span> why should the creditor demand payment from a man who is merely
      using what is now his own?</p>
      <p>The part played by authority in all this is obvious. There were the
      texts in Exodus and Leviticus; there was Luke <abbr title="6">vi</abbr>.
      35—apparently a mistranslation; there was a passage in the
      <i>Politics</i>, which some now say was mistranslated also.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-61" id="noteref-1-61">61</a>] But practical
      considerations contributed more to the doctrine than is sometimes
      supposed. Its character had been given it in an age in which most loans
      were not part of a credit system, but an exceptional expedient, and in
      which it could be said that “he who borrows is always under stress of
      necessity.” If usury were general, it was argued, “men would not give
      thought to the cultivation of their land, except when they could do nought
      else, and so there would be so great a famine that all the poor would die
      of hunger; for even if they could get land to cultivate, they would not be
      able to get the beasts and implements for cultivating it, since the poor
      themselves would not have them, and the rich, for the sake both of profit
      and of security, would put their money into usury rather than into smaller
      and more risky investments.”[<a href="#footnote-1-62"
      id="noteref-1-62">62</a>] The man who used these arguments was not an
      academic dreamer. He was Innocent <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr>, a
      consummate man of business, a believer, even to excess, in <i
      lang="de">Realpolitik</i>, and one of the ablest statesmen of his day.</p>
      <p>True, the Church could not dispense with commercial wickedness in high
      places. It was too convenient. The distinction between pawnbroking, which
      is disreputable, and high finance, which is eminently honorable, was as
      familiar in the Age of Faith as in the twentieth century; and no
      reasonable judgment of the medieval denunciation of usury is possible,
      unless it is remembered that whole ranges of financial business escaped
      from it almost altogether. It was rarely applied to the large-scale
      transactions of kings, feudal magnates, bishops and abbots. Their
      subjects, squeezed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> pay
      a foreign money-lender, might grumble or rebel, but, if an Edward <abbr
      title="the third">III</abbr> or a Count of Champagne was in the hands of
      financiers, who could bring either debtor or creditor to book? It was even
      more rarely applied to the Papacy itself; Popes regularly employed the
      international banking-houses of the day, with a singular indifference, as
      was frequently complained, to the morality of their business methods, took
      them under their special protection, and sometimes enforced the payment of
      debts by the threat of excommunication. As a rule, in spite of some
      qualms, the international money-market escaped from it; in the fourteenth
      century Italy was full of banking-houses doing foreign exchange business
      in every commercial center from Constantinople to London, and in the great
      fairs, such as those of Champagne, a special period was regularly set
      aside for the negotiation of loans and the settlement of debts.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-63" id="noteref-1-63">63</a>]</p>
      <p>It was not that transactions of this type were expressly excepted; on
      the contrary, each of them from time to time evoked the protests of
      moralists. Nor was it mere hypocrisy which caused the traditional doctrine
      to be repeated by writers who were perfectly well aware that neither
      commerce nor government could be carried on without credit. It was that
      the whole body of intellectual assumptions and practical interests, on
      which the prohibition of usury was based, had reference to a quite
      different order of economic activities from that represented by loans from
      great banking-houses to the merchants and potentates who were their
      clients. Its object was simple and direct—to prevent the well-to-do
      money-lender from exploiting the necessities of the peasant or the
      craftsman; its categories, which were quite appropriate to that type of
      transaction, were those of personal morality. It was in these commonplace
      dealings among small men that oppression was easiest and its results most
      pitiable. It was for them that the Church’s scheme of<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> economic ethics had been worked out, and with
      reference to them, though set at naught in high places, it was meant to be
      enforced, for it was part of Christian charity.</p>
      <p>It was enforced partly by secular authorities, partly, in so far as the
      rivalry of secular authorities would permit it, by the machinery of
      ecclesiastical discipline. The ecclesiastical legislation on the subject
      of usury has been so often analyzed that it is needless to do more than
      allude to it. Early Councils had forbidden usury to be taken by the
      clergy.[<a href="#footnote-1-64" id="noteref-1-64">64</a>] The Councils of
      the twelfth and thirteenth centuries forbid it to be taken by clergy or
      laity, and lay down rules for dealing with offenders. Clergy who lend
      money to persons in need, take their possessions in pawn, and receive
      profits beyond the capital sum lent, are to be deprived of their
      office.[<a href="#footnote-1-65" id="noteref-1-65">65</a>] Manifest
      usurers are not to be admitted to communion or Christian burial; their
      offerings are not to be accepted; and ecclesiastics who fail to punish
      them are to be suspended until they make satisfaction to their bishop.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-66" id="noteref-1-66">66</a>] The high-water mark of the
      ecclesiastical attack on usury was probably reached in the legislation of
      the Councils of Lyons (1274) and of Vienne (1312). The former re-enacted
      the measures laid down by the third Lateran Council (1175), and
      supplemented them by rules which virtually made the money-lender an
      outlaw. No individual or society, under pain of excommunication or
      interdict, was to let houses to usurers, but was to expel them (had they
      been admitted) within three months. They were to be refused confession,
      absolution and Christian burial until they had made restitution, and their
      wills were to be invalid.[<a href="#footnote-1-67"
      id="noteref-1-67">67</a>] The legislation of the Council of Vienne was
      even more sweeping. Declaring that it has learned with dismay that there
      are communities which, contrary to human and divine law, sanction usury
      and compel debtors to observe usurious contracts, it declares that all
      rulers and magistrates knowingly maintaining such laws are to incur
      excommunication, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
      requires the legislation in question to be revoked within three months.
      Since the true nature of usurious transactions is often concealed beneath
      various specious devices, money-lenders are to be compelled by the
      ecclesiastical authorities to submit their accounts to examination. Any
      person obstinately declaring that usury is not a sin is to be punished as
      a heretic, and inquisitors are to proceed against him <i lang="la">tanquam
      contra diffamatos vel suspectos de hæresi</i>.[<a href="#footnote-1-68"
      id="noteref-1-68">68</a>]</p>
      <p>It would not be easy to find a more drastic example, either of
      ecclesiastical sovereignty, or of the attempt to assert the superiority of
      the moral law to economic expediency, than the requirement, under threat
      of excommunication, that all secular legislation sanctioning usury shall
      be repealed. But, for an understanding of the way in which the system was
      intended to work, the enactments of Councils are perhaps less illuminating
      than the correspondence between the papal <i lang="la">Curia</i> and
      subordinate ecclesiastical authorities on specific cases and questions of
      interpretation. Are the heirs of those who have made money by usury bound
      to make restitution? Yes, the same penalties are to be applied to them as
      to the original offenders. The pious object of ransoming prisoners is not
      to justify the asking of a price for a loan. A man is to be accounted a
      usurer, not only if he charges interest, but if he allows for the element
      of time in a bargain, by asking a higher price when he sells on credit.
      Even when debtors have sworn not to proceed against usurers, the
      ecclesiastical authorities are to compel the latter to restore their
      gains, and, if witnesses are terrorized by the protection given to usurers
      by the powerful, punishment can be imposed without their evidence,
      provided that the offence is a matter of common notoriety. An archbishop
      of Canterbury is reminded that usury is perilous, not only for the clergy,
      but for all men whatever, and is warned to use ecclesiastical censures to
      secure the restoration, without the deduction of interest, of property
      which has been pawned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
      Usurers, says a papal letter to the archbishop of Salerno, object to
      restoring gains, or say that they have not the means; he is to compel all
      who can to make restitution, either to those from whom interest was taken,
      or to their heirs; when neither course is possible, they are to give it to
      the poor; for, as Augustine says, <i lang="la">non remittitur peccatum,
      nisi restituitur ablatum</i>. At Genoa, the Pope is informed, a practice
      obtains of undertaking to pay, at the end of a given term, a higher price
      for wares than they were worth at the moment when the sale took place. It
      is not clear that such contracts are necessarily usurious; nevertheless,
      the sellers run into sin, unless there is a probability that the wares
      will have changed in value by the time that payment is made; “and
      therefore your fellow-citizens would show a wise regard for their
      salvation if they ceased making contracts of the kind, since the thoughts
      of men cannot be concealed from Almighty God.”[<a href="#footnote-1-69"

      <p>It is evident from the number of doubtful cases referred to Rome for
      decision that the law with regard to usury was not easily administered. It
      is evident, also, that efforts were made to offer guidance in dealing with
      difficult and technical problems. In the book of common forms, drawn up in
      the thirteenth century for the guidance of the papal penitentiary in
      dealing with hard cases, precedents were inserted to show how usurers
      should be handled.[<a href="#footnote-1-70" id="noteref-1-70">70</a>]
      About the same time appeared
      <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Raymond’s guide to the duties of an
      archdeacon, which contains a long list of inquiries to be made on
      visitation, covering every conceivable kind of extortion, and designed to
      expose the various illusory contracts—fictitious partnerships, loans under
      the guise of sales, excessive deposits against advances—by which the
      offence was concealed.[<a href="#footnote-1-71" id="noteref-1-71">71</a>]
      Instructions to confessors define in equal detail the procedure to be
      followed. The confessor, states a series of synodal statutes, is to “make
      inquiry concerning merchandising, and other things pertaining to avarice
      and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span> covetousness.” Barons
      and knights are to be requested to state whether they have made ordinances
      contrary to the liberty of the Church, or refused justice to any man
      seeking it, or oppressed their subjects with undue tallages, tolls or
      services. “Concerning burgesses, merchants and officers (<i
      lang="la">ministrales</i>) the priest is to make inquiry as to rapine,
      usury, pledges made by deceit of usury, barratry, false and lying sales,
      unjust weights and measures, lying, perjury and craft. Concerning
      cultivators (<i lang="la">agricolas</i>) he is to inquire as to theft and
      detention of the property of others, especially with regard to tithes ...
      also as to the removing of landmarks and the occupation of other men’s
      land.... Concerning avarice it is to be asked in this wise: hast thou been
      guilty of simony ... an unjust judge ... a thief, a robber, a perjurer, a
      sacrilegious man, a gambler, a remover of landmarks in fields ... a false
      merchant, an oppressor of any man and above all of widows, wards and
      others in misery, for the sake of unjust and greedy gain?” Those guilty of
      avarice are to do penance by giving large alms, on the principle that
      “contraries are to be cured with contraries.” But there are certain sins
      for which no true penitence is possible until restitution has been made.
      Of these usury is one; and usury, it is to be noted, includes, not only
      what would now be called interest, but the sin of those who, on account of
      lapse of time, sell dearer and buy cheaper. If for practical reasons
      restitution is impossible, the offender is to be instructed to require
      that it shall be made by his heirs, and, when the injured party cannot be
      found, the money is to be spent, with the advice of the bishop if the sum
      is large and of the priest if it is small, “on pious works and especially
      on the poor.”[<a href="#footnote-1-72" id="noteref-1-72">72</a>]</p>
      <p>The more popular teaching on the subject is illustrated by the manuals
      for use in the confessional and by books for the guidance of the devout.
      The space given in them to the ethics of business was considerable. In the
      fifteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> century, Bishop
      Pecock could meet the Lollards’ complaint that the Scriptures were buried
      beneath a mass of interpretation, by taking as his illustration the books
      which had been written on the text, “Lend, hoping for nothing again,” and
      arguing that all this teaching upon usury was little enough “to answer ...
      all the hard, scrupulous doubts and questions which all day have need to
      be assoiled in men’s bargains and chafferings together.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-73" id="noteref-1-73">73</a>] A century later there were
      regions in which such doctrine was still being rehearsed with all the old
      rigor. In 1552 the Parliament which made the Scottish Reformation was only
      eight years off. But the catechism of the archbishop of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrews, which was drawn up in that year, shows
      no disposition to compromise with the economic frailties of his
      fellow-countrymen. It denounces usurers, masters who withhold wages,
      covetous merchants who sell fraudulent wares, covetous landlords who grind
      their tenants, and in general—a comprehensive and embarrassing
      indictment—“all wretches that will be grown rich incontinent,” and all
      “who may keep their neighbor from poverty and mischance and do it not.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-74" id="noteref-1-74">74</a>]</p>
      <p>On the crucial question, how the ecclesiastical courts dealt in
      practice with these matters, we have very little light. They are still
      almost an unworked field. On the Continent we catch glimpses of occasional
      raids. Bishops declare war on notorious usurers, only to evoke reprisals
      from the secular authorities, to whom the money-lender is too convenient
      to be victimized by any one but themselves.[<a href="#footnote-1-75"
      id="noteref-1-75">75</a>] At the end of the thirteenth century an
      archbishop of Bourges makes some thirty-five usurers disgorge at a
      sitting,[<a href="#footnote-1-76" id="noteref-1-76">76</a>] and seventy
      years later an inquisitor at Florence collects 7,000 florins in two years
      from usurers and blasphemers.[<a href="#footnote-1-77"
      id="noteref-1-77">77</a>] In England commercial morality was a debatable
      land, in which ecclesiastical and secular authorities contended from time
      to time for jurisdiction. The ecclesiastical courts claimed to deal with
      cases of breach of contract in general, on the<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> ground that they involved <i lang="la">læsio
      fidei</i>, and with usury in particular, as an offence against morality
      specifically forbidden by the canon law. Both claims were contested by the
      Crown and by municipal bodies. The former, by the Constitutions of
      Clarendon,[<a href="#footnote-1-78" id="noteref-1-78">78</a>] had
      expressly reserved proceedings as to debts for the royal courts, and the
      same rule was laid down more than once in the course of the next century.
      The latter again and again forbade burgesses to take proceedings in the
      courts christian, and fined those who disregarded the prohibition.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-79" id="noteref-1-79">79</a>] Both, in spite of repeated
      protests from the clergy,[<a href="#footnote-1-80"
      id="noteref-1-80">80</a>] made good their pretension to handle usurious
      contracts in secular courts; but neither succeeded in ousting the
      jurisdiction of the Church. The question at issue was not whether the
      usurer should be punished—a point as to which there was only one
      opinion—but who should have the lucrative business of punishing him, and
      in practice he ran the gauntlet of all and of each. Local authorities,
      from the City of London to the humblest manorial court, make by-laws
      against “unlawful chevisance” and present offenders against them.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-81" id="noteref-1-81">81</a>] The Commons pray that
      Lombard brokers may be banished, and that the ordinances of London
      concerning them may be made of general application.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-82" id="noteref-1-82">82</a>] The justices in eyre hear
      indictments of usurers,[<a href="#footnote-1-83" id="noteref-1-83">83</a>]
      and the Court of Chancery handles petitions from victims who can get no
      redress at common law.[<a href="#footnote-1-84" id="noteref-1-84">84</a>]
      And Holy Church, though there seems to be only one example of legislation
      on the subject by an English Church Council,[<a href="#footnote-1-85"
      id="noteref-1-85">85</a>] continues to deal with the usurer after her own
      manner.</p>
      <p>For, in spite of the conflict of jurisdictions, the rising resentment
      against the ways of ecclesiastical lawyers, and the expanding capitalism
      of the later Middle Ages, it is evident that commercial cases continued,
      on occasion at least, to come before the courts christian. Nor, after the
      middle of the fourteenth century, was their right to try cases of usury
      contested by the secular authorities. A<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> statute of 1341 enacted that (as laid down
      long before) the King should have cognizance of usurers dead, and the
      Church of usurers living. The same reservation of ecclesiastical rights
      was repeated when the question was taken up a century later under Henry
      <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr>, and survived, an antiquated piece of
      common form, even into the age of lusty capitalism under Elizabeth and
      James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>.[<a href="#footnote-1-86"
      id="noteref-1-86">86</a>]</p>
      <p>That ecclesiastical authorities had much opportunity of enforcing the
      canon law in connection with money-lending is improbable. It was naturally
      in the commercial towns that cases of the kind most frequently arose, and
      the towns did not look with favor on the interference of churchmen in
      matters of business. In London, collisions between the courts of the
      Official, the Mayor and the King were frequent in the early thirteenth
      century. Men took proceedings before the first, it seems, when a speedy
      decision was desired, or when their case was of a kind which secular
      courts were not likely to regard with favor. Thus craftsmen, to give one
      curious example out of many, were evidently using the courts christian as
      a means of giving effect to trade union regulations, which were more
      likely to be punished than enforced by the mayor and aldermen, by the
      simple device of imposing an oath and proceeding against those who broke
      it for breach of faith. The smiths, for instance, made a “confederacy,”
      supported by an oath, with the object, as they declared, of putting down
      night-work, but, as was alleged in court, of preventing any but members of
      their organization from working at the trade, and summoned blacklegs
      before the ecclesiastical courts. The spurriers forbade any one to work
      between sunset and sunrise, and haled an offending journeyman before the
      archdeacon, with the result that “the said Richard, after being three
      times warned by the Official, had been expelled from the Church and
      excommunicated, until he would swear to keep the ordinance.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-87" id="noteref-1-87">87</a>]<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>
      <p>Even at a later period the glimpses which we catch of the activities of
      the ecclesiastical jurisdiction are enough to show that it was not wholly
      a dead letter. Priests accused of usury undergo correction at the hands of
      their bishops.[<a href="#footnote-1-88" id="noteref-1-88">88</a>]
      Petitioners appeal for redress to the Court of Chancery on the ground that
      they have failed to secure justice in the courts of bishops or
      archdeacons, where actions on cases of debts or usury have been begun
      before “spiritual men.”[<a href="#footnote-1-89" id="noteref-1-89">89</a>]
      The records of ecclesiastical courts show that, though sometimes
      commercial questions were dismissed as belonging to the secular courts,
      cases of breach of contract and usury continued, nevertheless, to be
      settled by them.[<a href="#footnote-1-90" id="noteref-1-90">90</a>] The
      disreputable family of Marcroft—William the father was a common usurer,
      Alice his daughter baked bread at Pentecost, and Edward his son made a
      shirt on All Saints’ Day—is punished by the ecclesiastical court of
      Whalley as it deserves.[<a href="#footnote-1-91" id="noteref-1-91">91</a>]
      At Ripon a usurer and his victim are induced to settle the case out of
      court.[<a href="#footnote-1-92" id="noteref-1-92">92</a>] The Commissary
      of London cites Thomas Hall <i lang="la">super crimine usurariæ
      pravitatis</i>, on the ground that, having advanced four shillings on the
      security of Thomas Foster’s belt, he had demanded twelve pence over and
      above the principal, and suspends him when he does not appear in court.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-93" id="noteref-1-93">93</a>] Nor did business of this
      kind cease with the Reformation. Cases of usury were being heard by
      ecclesiastical courts under Elizabeth, and even in a great commercial
      center like the City of London it was still possible in the reign of James
      <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> for the Bishop’s Commissary to be trying
      tradesmen for “lending upon pawnes for an excessive gain.”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-94" id="noteref-1-94">94</a>]</p>
      <p>It was not only by legal penalties, however, that an attempt was made
      to raise a defensive barrier against the exactions of the money-lender.
      From a very early date there was a school of opinion which held that, in
      view of the various stratagems by which usurious contracts could be
      “colored,” direct prohibition was almost necessarily impotent,<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> and which favored the policy
      of providing facilities for borrowing on more reasonable terms than could
      be obtained from the money-lender. Ecclesiastics try, in fact, to turn the
      flank of the usurer by establishing institutions where the poor can raise
      capital cheaply. Parishes, religious fraternities, gilds, hospitals and
      perhaps monasteries lend corn, cattle and money.[<a href="#footnote-1-95"
      id="noteref-1-95">95</a>] In England, bishops are organizing such loans
      with papal approval in the middle of the thirteenth century,[<a
      href="#footnote-1-96" id="noteref-1-96">96</a>] and two centuries later,
      about 1462, the Franciscans lead the movement for the creation of <i
      lang="fr">Monts de Piété</i>, which, starting in Italy, spread by the
      first half of the sixteenth century to France, Germany, and the Low
      Countries, and, though never taken up in England—for the Reformation
      intervened—supplied a topic of frequent comment and eulogy to English
      writers on economic ethics.[<a href="#footnote-1-97"
      id="noteref-1-97">97</a>] The canon law on the subject of money-lending
      underwent a steady development, caused by the necessity of adapting it to
      the increasing complexity of business organization, down at least to the
      Lateran Council of 1515. The ingenuity with which professional opinion
      elaborated the code was itself a proof that considerable business—and
      fees—were the result of it, for lawyers do not serve God for naught. The
      canonists, who had a bad reputation with the laity, were not, to put it
      mildly, more innocent than other lawyers in the gentle art of making
      business. The Italians, in particular, as was natural in the financial
      capital of Europe, made the pace, and Italian canonists performed
      prodigies of legal ingenuity. In England, on the other hand, either
      because Englishmen were unusually virtuous, or, as a foreigner unkindly
      said, because “they do not fear to make contracts on usury,”[<a
      href="#footnote-1-98" id="noteref-1-98">98</a>] or, most probably, because
      English business was a conservative and slow-going affair, the English
      canonist Lyndwood is content to quote a sentence from an English
      archbishop of the thirteenth century and to leave it at that.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-99" id="noteref-1-99">99</a>]<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
      <p>But, however lawyers might distinguish and refine, the essential facts
      were simple. The Church sees buying and selling, lending and borrowing, as
      a simple case of neighborly or unneighborly conduct. Though a rationalist
      like Bishop Pecock may insist that the rich, as such, are not hateful to
      God,[<a href="#footnote-1-100" id="noteref-1-100">100</a>] it has a
      traditional prejudice against the arts by which men—or at least
      laymen—acquire riches, and is apt to lump them together under the ugly
      name of avarice. Merchants who organize a ring, or money-lenders who grind
      the poor, it regards, not as business strategists, but as <i
      lang="la">nefandæ belluæ</i>—monsters of iniquity. As for grocers and
      victualers “who conspire wickedly together that none shall sell better
      cheap than another,” and speculators “who buy up corn, meat and wine ...
      to amass money at the cost of others,” they are “according to the laws of
      the Church no better than common criminals.”[<a href="#footnote-1-101"
      id="noteref-1-101">101</a>] So, when the price of bread rises, or when the
      London fruiterers, persuaded by one bold spirit that they are “all poor
      and caitiffs on account of their own simplicity, and if they would act on
      his advice they would be rich and powerful,”[<a href="#footnote-1-102"
      id="noteref-1-102">102</a>] form a combine, to the great loss and hardship
      of the people, burgesses and peasants do not console themselves with the
      larger hope that the laws of supply and demand may bring prices down
      again. Strong in the approval of all good Christians, they stand the
      miller in the pillory, and reason with the fruiterers in the court of the
      mayor. And the parish priest delivers a sermon on the sixth commandment,
      choosing as his text the words of the Book of Proverbs, “Give me neither
      riches nor poverty, but enough for my sustenance.”</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-1-3"><abbr title="3">III</abbr>. THE IDEAL AND THE
      REALITY</h3>
      <p>Such, in brief outline, was the background of economic thought which
      the sixteenth century inherited, and which<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> it brought to the bewildering changes in land
      tenure, in prices, in commercial and financial organization, that made the
      age a watershed in economic development. It is evident that the whole
      implication of this philosophy was, on one side, intensely conservative.
      There was no question of progress, still less of any radical social
      reconstruction. In the numerous heretical movements of the Middle Ages
      social aspirations were often combined with criticisms of the luxury and
      pomp of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The official Church, to which
      independence of thought among the lower orders was but little less
      abhorrent when it related to their temporal well-being than when it was
      concerned with their eternal salvation, frowned upon these dangerous
      speculations, and sometimes crushed them with a ferocity as relentless as
      the most savage of the White Terrors of modern history has shown to the
      most formidable of insurrections.</p>
      <p>Intellectually, religious opinion endorsed to the full the static view,
      which regarded the social order as a thing unalterable, to be accepted,
      not to be improved. Except on rare occasions, its spokesmen repeated the
      conventional doctrine, according to which the feet were born to labor, the
      hands to fight, and the head to rule. Naturally, therefore, they denounced
      agitations, like the communal movement,[<a href="#footnote-1-103"
      id="noteref-1-103">103</a>] designed to overturn that natural order,
      though the rise of the Free Cities was one of the glories of medieval
      Europe and the germ of almost every subsequent advance in civilization.
      They referred to questions of economic conduct, not because they were
      anxious to promote reforms, but because they were concerned with the
      maintenance of traditional standards of personal morality, of which
      economic conduct formed an important part.</p>
      <p>Practically, the Church was an immense vested interest, implicated to
      the hilt in the economic fabric, especially on the side of agriculture and
      land tenure. Itself the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg
      57]</span> of landowners, it could no more quarrel with the feudal
      structure than the Ecclesiastical Commission, the largest of mineral
      owners today, can lead a crusade against royalties. The persecution of the
      Spiritual Franciscans, who dared, in defiance of the bull of John <abbr
      title="XXII">XXII</abbr>, to maintain <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
      Francis’ rule as to evangelical poverty, suggests that doctrines impugning
      the sanctity of wealth resembled too closely the teaching of Christ to be
      acceptable to the princes of the Christian Church.</p>
      <p>The basis of the whole medieval economic system, under which, except in
      Italy and Flanders, more than nine-tenths of the population consisted of
      agriculturists, had been serfdom or villeinage. Confronted in the
      sixteenth century with the unfamiliar evils of competitive agriculture,
      conservative reformers were to sigh for the social harmonies of a vanished
      age, which “knyt suche a knott of colaterall amytie betwene the Lordes and
      the tenaunts that the Lorde tendered his tenaunt as his childe, and the
      tenaunts againe loved and obeyed the Lorde as naturellye as the childe the
      father.”[<a href="#footnote-1-104" id="noteref-1-104">104</a>] Their
      idealization of the past is as misleading, as an account of the conditions
      of previous centuries, as it is illuminating as a comment upon those of
      their own. In reality, so far as the servile tenants, who formed the bulk
      of medieval agriculturists, were concerned, the golden age of peasant
      prosperity is, except here and there, a romantic myth, at which no one
      would have been more surprised than the peasants themselves. The very
      essence of feudal property was exploitation in its most naked and
      shameless form, compulsory labor, additional <i lang="fr">corvées</i> at
      the very moments when the peasant’s labor was most urgently needed on his
      own holding, innumerable dues and payments, the obligation to grind at the
      lord’s mill and bake at the lord’s oven, the private justice of the lord’s
      court. The custom of the manor, the scarcity of labor, and, in England,
      the steadily advancing encroachments of<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> the royal courts, blunted the edge of the
      system, and in fifteenth-century England a prosperous yeomanry was rising
      on its ruins. But, during the greater part of the Middle Ages, its
      cumulative weight had been, nevertheless, immense. Those who lived under
      it had no illusions as to its harshness. The first step which the peasant
      who had saved a little money took was to buy himself out of the obligation
      to work on the lord’s demesne. The Peasants’ Revolt in England, the <i
      lang="fr">Jacquerie</i> in France and the repeated risings of the German
      peasantry reveal a state of social exasperation which has been surpassed
      in bitterness by few subsequent movements.</p>
      <p>It is natural to ask (though some writers on medieval economics refrain
      from asking) what the attitude of religious opinion was towards serfdom.
      And it is hardly possible to answer that question except by saying that,
      apart from a few exceptional individuals, religious opinion ignored it.
      True, the Church condemned arbitrary tallages, and urged that the serf
      should be treated with humanity. True, it described the manumission of
      serfs as an act of piety, like gifts to the poor. For serfs are not
      “living tools,” but men; in the eyes of God all men are serfs together, <i
      lang="la">conservi</i>, and in the Kingdom of Heaven Lazarus is before
      Dives.[<a href="#footnote-1-105" id="noteref-1-105">105</a>] True,
      villeinage was a legal, not an economic, category; in the England of the
      fourteenth century there were serfs who were rich men. But to release the
      individual is not to condemn the institution. Whatever “mad priests” might
      say and do, the official Church, whose wealth consisted largely of
      villeins, walked with circumspection.</p>
      <p>The canon law appears to have recognized and enforced serfdom.[<a
      href="#footnote-1-106" id="noteref-1-106">106</a>] Few prominent
      ecclesiastics made any pronouncement against it. Aquinas explains it as
      the result of sin, but that does not prevent his justifying it on economic
      grounds.[<a href="#footnote-1-107" id="noteref-1-107">107</a>] Almost all
      medieval writers appear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg
      59]</span> assume it or excuse it. Ecclesiastical landlords, though
      perhaps somewhat more conservative in their methods, seem as a whole to
      have been neither better nor worse than other landlords. <i
      lang="la">Rustica gens optima flens, pessima gaudens</i>, was a sentiment
      which sometimes appealed, it is to be feared, to the children of light
      concerned with rent rolls and farming profits, not less than to the feudal
      aristocracy, with whom the heads of the ecclesiastical hierarchy were
      inextricably intermingled. When their chance came, John Nameless, and John
      the Miller, and John Carter, who may be presumed to have known their
      friends, burned the court rolls of an abbot of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Albans, and cut off the head of an archbishop,
      and ran riot on the estates of an abbot of Kempten, with not less
      enthusiasm than they showed in plundering their lay exploiters. It was not
      the Church, but revolting peasants in Germany and England, who appealed to
      the fact that “Christ has made all men free”;[<a href="#footnote-1-108"
      id="noteref-1-108">108</a>] and in Germany, at least, their ecclesiastical
      masters showed small mercy to them. The disappearance of serfdom—and,
      after all, it did not disappear from France till late in the eighteenth
      century, and from Germany till the nineteenth—was part of a general
      economic movement, with which the Church had little to do, and which
      churchmen, as property-owners, had sometimes resisted. It owed less to
      Christianity than to the humanitarian liberalism of the French
      Revolution.</p>
      <p>The truth was that the very triumph of the Church closed its mouth. The
      Church of the third century, a minority of believers confronted with an
      alien civilization, might protest and criticize. But, when the whole
      leaven was mixed with the lump, when the Church was regarded, not as
      <i>a</i> society, but as society itself, it was inevitably diluted by the
      mass which it absorbed. The result was a compromise—a compromise of which
      the critic can say, “How much that was intolerable was accepted!” and
      the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> eulogist, “How much
      that was intolerable was softened!”</p>
      <p>Both critic and eulogist are right. For if religious opinion acquiesced
      in much, it also claimed much, and the habit of mind which made the
      medieval Church almost impotent when dealing with the serried abuses of
      the medieval land system was precisely that which made it strong, at least
      in theory, in dealing with the economic transactions of the individual. In
      the earlier Middle Ages it had stood for the protection of peaceful labor,
      for the care of the poor, the unfortunate and the oppressed—for the ideal,
      at least, of social solidarity against the naked force of violence and
      oppression. With the growing complexity of economic civilization, it was
      confronted with problems not easily handled by its traditional categories.
      But, if applied capriciously, they were not renounced, and the world of
      economic morality, which baffles us today, was in its turn converted by it
      into a new, though embarrassing, opportunity. Whatever emphasis may be
      laid—and emphasis can hardly be too strong—upon the gulf between theory
      and practice, the qualifications stultifying principles, and the casuistry
      by which the work of canonists, not less than of other lawyers, was
      disfigured, the endeavor to draw the most commonplace of human activities
      and the least tractable of human appetites within the all-embracing circle
      of a universal system still glows through it all with a certain tarnished
      splendor. When the distinction between that which is permissible in
      private life and that which is permissible in business offers so plausible
      an escape from the judgment pronounced on covetousness, it is something to
      have insisted that the law of charity is binding on the second not less
      than on the first. When the austerity of principles can be evaded by
      treating them as applicable only to those relations of life in which their
      application is least exacting, it is something to have attempted to
      construct a system tough enough to stand against commercial
      unscrupulousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> but yet
      sufficiently elastic to admit any legitimate transaction. If it is proper
      to insist on the prevalence of avarice and greed in high places, it is not
      less important to observe that men called these vices by their right
      names, and had not learned to persuade themselves that greed was
      enterprise and avarice economy.</p>
      <p>Such antitheses are tempting, and it is not surprising that some
      writers should have dwelt upon them. To a generation disillusioned with
      free competition, and disposed to demand some criterion of social
      expediency more cogent than the verdict of the market, the jealous and
      cynical suspicion of economic egotism, which was the prevalent mood of the
      Middle Ages, is more intelligible than it was to the sanguine optimists of
      the Age of Reason, which, as far as its theory of the conduct of men in
      society is concerned, deserves much more than the thirteenth century to be
      described as the Age of Faith. In the twentieth century, with its trusts
      and combines, its control of industry by business and of both by finance,
      its attempts to fix fair wages and fair prices, its rationing and food
      controls and textile controls, the economic harmonies are, perhaps, a
      little blown upon. The temper in which it approaches questions of economic
      organization appears to have more affinity with the rage of the medieval
      burgess at the uncharitable covetousness of the usurer and the engrosser,
      than it has with the confidence reposed by its innocent grandfathers in
      the infallible operations of the invisible hand.</p>
      <p>The resemblance, however, though genuine, is superficial, and to
      over-emphasize it is to do less than justice to precisely those elements
      in medieval thought which were most characteristic. The significance of
      its contribution consists, not in its particular theories as to prices and
      interest, which recur in all ages, whenever the circumstances of the
      economic environment expose consumer and borrower<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> to extortion, but in its insistence that
      society is a spiritual organism, not an economic machine, and that
      economic activity, which is one subordinate element within a vast and
      complex unity, requires to be controlled and repressed by reference to the
      moral ends for which it supplies the material means. So merciless is the
      tyranny of economic appetites, so prone to self-aggrandizement the empire
      of economic interests, that a doctrine which confines them to their proper
      sphere, as the servant, not the master, of civilization, may reasonably be
      regarded as among the pregnant truisms which are a permanent element in
      any sane philosophy. Nor is it, perhaps, as clear today as it seemed a
      century ago, that it has been an unmixed gain to substitute the criterion
      of economic expediency, so easily interpreted in terms of quantity and
      mass, for the conception of a rule of life superior to individual desires
      and temporary exigencies, which was what the medieval theorist meant by
      “natural law.”</p>
      <p>When all is said, the fact remains that, on the small scale involved,
      the problem of moralizing economic life was faced and not abandoned. The
      experiment may have been impracticable, and almost from the first it was
      discredited by the notorious corruption of ecclesiastical authorities, who
      preached renunciation and gave a lesson in greed. But it had in it
      something of the heroic, and to ignore the nobility of the conception is
      not less absurd than to idealize its practical results. The best proof of
      the appeal which the attempt to subordinate economic interests to religion
      had made is the persistence of the same attempt among reformers, to whom
      the Pope was anti-Christ and the canon law an abomination and the horror
      of decent men when, in the sixteenth century, its breakdown became too
      obvious to be contested.</p>

      <hr>
      <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>Lord Acton, in an
      unforgettable passage in his
      <i>Inaugural Lecture on the Study of History</i>, has said that “after
      many ages persuaded of the headlong decline and impending dissolution of
      society, and governed by usage and the will of masters who were in their
      graves, the sixteenth century went forth armed for untried experience, and
      ready to watch with hopefulness a prospect of incalculable change.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-1" id="noteref-2-1">1</a>] His reference was to the new
      world revealed by learning, by science, and by discovery. But his words
      offer an appropriate text for a discussion of the change in the conception
      of the relations between religion and secular interests which took place
      in the same period. Its inevitable consequence was the emergence, after a
      prolonged moral and intellectual conflict, of new conceptions of social
      expediency and of new lines of economic thought.</p>
      <p>The strands in this movement were complex, and the formula which
      associates the Reformation with the rise of economic individualism is no
      complete explanation. Systems prepare their own overthrow by a preliminary
      process of petrifaction. The traditional social philosophy was static, in
      the sense that it assumed a body of class relations sharply defined by
      custom and law, and little affected by the ebb and flow of economic
      movements. Its weakness in the face of novel forces was as obvious as the
      strain put upon it by the revolt against the source of ecclesiastical
      jurisprudence, the partial discredit of the canon law and of
      ecclesiastical discipline, and the rise of a political science equipped
      from the arsenals of antiquity. But it is not to under-estimate the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> effect of the Reformation to
      say that the principal causes making the age a watershed, from which new
      streams of social theory descend, lay in another region. Mankind does not
      reflect upon questions of economic and social organization until compelled
      to do so by the sharp pressure of some practical emergency. The sixteenth
      century was an age of social speculation for the same reason as the early
      nineteenth—because it was an age of social dislocation. The retort of
      conservative religious teachers to a spirit which seems to them the
      triumph of Mammon produces the last great literary expression of the
      appeal to the average conscience which had been made by an older social
      order. The practical implications of the social theory of the Middle Ages
      are stated more clearly in the sixteenth century than even in its zenith,
      because they are stated with the emphasis of a creed which is menaced.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-2-1"><abbr title="1">I</abbr>. THE ECONOMIC
      REVOLUTION</h3>
      <p>The religious revolution of the age came on a world heaving with the
      vastest economic crisis that Europe had experienced since the fall of
      Rome. Art and scientific curiosity and technical skill, learning and
      statesmanship, the scholarship which explored the past and the prophetic
      vision which pierced the future, had all poured their treasures into the
      sumptuous shrine of the new civilization. Behind the genii of beauty and
      wisdom who were its architects there moved a murky, but indispensable,
      figure. It was the demon whom Dante had met muttering gibberish in the
      fourth circle of the Inferno, and whom Sir Guyon was to encounter three
      centuries later, tanned with smoke and seared with fire, in a cave
      adjoining the mouth of hell. His uncouth labors quarried the stones which
      Michael Angelo was to raise, and sank deep in the Roman clay the
      foundations of the walls to be adorned by Raphael.<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>
      <p>For it was the mastery of man over his environment which heralded the
      dawn of the new age, and it was in the stress of expanding economic
      energies that this mastery was proved and won. Like sovereignty in a
      feudal society, the economic efforts of the Middle Ages, except in a few
      favored spots, had been fragmentary and decentralized. Now the scattered
      raiders were to be organized and disciplined; the dispersed and irregular
      skirmishes were to be merged in a grand struggle, on a front which
      stretched from the Baltic to the Ganges and from the Spice Islands to
      Peru. Every year brought the news of fresh triumphs. The general who
      marshaled the host and launched the attack was economic power.</p>
      <p>Economic power, long at home in Italy, was leaking through a thousand
      creeks and inlets into western Europe, for a century before, with the
      climax of the great Discoveries, the flood came on breast-high. Whatever
      its truth as a judgment on the politics of the fifteenth century, the
      conventional verdict on its futility does scanty justice to its economic
      significance. It was in an age of political anarchy that the forces
      destined to dominate the future tried their wings. The era of Columbus and
      Da Gama was prepared by the patient labor of Italian cartographers and
      Portuguese seamen, as certainly as was that of Crompton and Watt by the
      obscure experiments of nameless predecessors.</p>
      <p>The master who set the problem that the heroes of the age were to solve
      was material necessity. The Europe of the earlier Middle Ages, like the
      world of the twentieth century, had been a closed circle. But it had been
      closed, not by the growth of knowledge, but by the continuance of
      ignorance; and, while the latter, having drawn the whole globe into a
      single economic system, has no space left for fresh expansion, for the
      former, with the Mediterranean as its immemorial pivot, expansion had
      hardly begun. Tapping the wealth of the East by way of the narrow
      apertures in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> Levant,
      it resembled, in the rigidity of the limits imposed on its commercial
      strategy, a giant fed through the chinks of a wall.</p>
      <p>As was the general scheme, so were the details; inelastic in its
      external, Europe was hardly more flexible in its internal, relations. Its
      primary unit had been the village; and the village, a community of
      agrarian shareholders fortified by custom, had repressed with a fury of
      virtuous unanimity the disorderly appetites which menaced its traditional
      routine with the evil whose name is Change. Beyond the village lay the
      greater, more privileged, village called the borough, and the brethren of
      borough and gild had turned on the foreign devil from upland and valley a
      face of flint. Above both were the slowly waking nations. Nationalism was
      an economic force before nationality was a political fact, and it was a
      sound reason for harrying a competitor that he was a Florentine or a man
      of the Emperor. The privileged colony with its depôt, the Steel-yard of
      the Hanseatic League, the Fondaco Tedesco of the south Germans, the
      Factory of the English Merchant Adventurers, were but tiny breaches in a
      wall of economic exclusiveness. Trade, as in modern Turkey or China, was
      carried on under capitulations.</p>
      <p>This narrow framework had been a home. In the fifteenth century it was
      felt to be a prison. Expanding energies pressed against the walls;
      restless appetites gnawed and fretted wherever a crack in the surface
      offered room for erosion. Long before the southward march of the Turks cut
      the last of the great routes from the East, the Venetian monopoly was felt
      to be intolerable. Long before the plunder of Mexico and the silver of
      Potosi flooded Europe with treasure, the mines of Germany and the Tyrol
      were yielding increasing, if still slender, streams of bullion, which
      stimulated rather than allayed its thirst.[<a href="#footnote-2-2"
      id="noteref-2-2">2</a>] It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg
      69]</span> the lords of great estates, but eager and prosperous peasants,
      who in England first nibbled at commons and undermined the manorial
      custom, behind which, as behind a dyke, their small savings had been
      accumulated. It was not great capitalists, but enterprising gildsmen, who
      began to make the control of the fraternity the basis of a system of
      plutocratic exploitation, or who fled, precocious individualists, from the
      fellowship of borough and craft, that they might grow to what stature they
      pleased in rural isolation. It was not even the Discoveries which first
      began the enormous tilt of economic power from south and east to north and
      west. The records of German and English trade suggest that the powers of
      northern Europe had for a century before the Discoveries been growing in
      wealth and civilization,[<a href="#footnote-2-3" id="noteref-2-3">3</a>]
      and for a century after them English economic development was to be as
      closely wedded to its continental connections as though Diaz had never
      rounded the Cape, nor Columbus praised Heaven for leading him to the
      shores of Zayton and Guinsay. First attempted as a counterpoise to the
      Italian monopolist, then pressed home with ever greater eagerness to turn
      the flank of the Turk, as his strangle-hold on the eastern commerce
      tightened, the Discoveries were neither a happy accident nor the fruit of
      the disinterested curiosity of science. They were the climax of almost a
      century of patient economic effort. They were as practical in their motive
      as the steam-engine.</p>
      <p>The result was not the less sensational because it had been long
      prepared. Heralded by an economic revolution not less profound than that
      of three centuries later, the new world of the sixteenth century took its
      character from the outburst of economic energy in which it had been born.
      Like the nineteenth century, it saw a swift increase in wealth and an
      impressive expansion of trade, a concentration of financial power on a
      scale unknown before, the rise, amid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg
      70]</span> fierce social convulsions, of new classes and the depression of
      old, the triumph of a new culture and system of ideas amid struggles not
      less bitter.</p>
      <p>It was an age of economic, not less than of political, sensations,
      which were recorded in the letter-books[<a href="#footnote-2-4"
      id="noteref-2-4">4</a>] of business men as well as in the state papers of
      Governments. The decline of Venice and of the south German cities which
      had distributed the products that Venice imported, and which henceforward
      must either be marooned far from the new trade routes or break out to the
      sea, as some of them did, by way of the Low Countries; the new economic
      imperialism of Portugal and Spain; the outburst of capitalist enterprise
      in mining and textiles; the rise of commercial companies, no longer local
      but international, and based, not merely on exclusive privileges, but on
      the power of massed capital to drive from the field all feebler
      competitors; a revolution in prices which shattered all customary
      relationships; the collapse of medieval rural society in a nightmare of
      peasants’ wars; the subjection of the collegiate industrial organization
      of the Middle Ages to a new money-power; the triumph of the State and its
      conquest, in great parts of Europe, of the Church—all were crowded into
      less than two generations. A man who was born when the Council of Basel
      was sitting saw also, if he lived to a ripe old age, the dissolution of
      the English monasteries. At the first date Portuguese explorers had hardly
      passed Sierra Leone; at the second Portugal had been the master of an
      Indian Empire for almost a generation. In the intervening three-quarters
      of a century the whole framework of European civilization had been
      transformed.</p>
      <p>Compared with the currents which raced in Italy, or Germany, or the Low
      Countries, English life was an economic back-water. But even its stagnant
      shallows were stirred by the eddy and rush of the continental whirlpool.
      When Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr> came to the throne, the
      economic organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> of
      the country differed but little from that of the age of Wyclif. When Henry
      <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> died, full of years and sin, some of
      the main characteristics which were to distinguish it till the advent of
      steam-power and machinery could already, though faintly, be descried. The
      door that remained to be unlocked was colonial expansion, and forty years
      later the first experiments in colonial expansion had begun.</p>
      <p>The phenomenon which dazzled contemporaries was the swift start into
      apparent opulence, first of Portugal and then of Spain. The nemesis of
      parasitic wealth was not discerned, and it was left for the cynical
      rationalism of an ambassador of that commercial republic, in comparison
      with whose hoary wisdom the new plutocrats of the West were meddlesome
      children, to observe that the true mines of the Spanish Empire lay, not in
      America, but in the sodden clay of the water-logged Netherlands.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-5" id="noteref-2-5">5</a>] The justice of the criticism
      was revealed when Spain, a corpse bound on the back of the most liberal
      and progressive community of the age, completed her own ruin by sacking
      the treasury from which, far more than from Potosi, her wealth had been
      drawn. But the beginnings of that long agony, in which the powerhouse of
      European enterprise was to be struck with paralysis, lay still in the
      future, and later generations of Spaniards looked back with pardonable
      exaggeration on the closing years of Charles <abbr title="the
      fifth">V</abbr> as a golden age of economic prosperity. Europe as a whole,
      however lacerated by political and religious struggles, seemed to have
      solved the most pressing of the economic problems which had haunted her in
      the later Middle Ages. During a thousand years of unresting struggle with
      marsh and forest and moor she had colonized her own waste places. That
      tremendous achievement almost accomplished, she now turned to the task of
      colonizing the world. No longer on the defensive, she entered on a phase
      of economic expansion which was to grow for the next four hundred years,
      and which only in the twentieth century was<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> to show signs of drawing towards its close.
      Once a year she was irrigated with the bullion of America, once a year she
      was enriched with a golden harvest from the East. The period of mere
      experiment over, and the new connections firmly established, she appeared
      to be in sight of an economic stability based on broader foundations than
      ever before.</p>
      <p>Portugal and Spain held the keys of the treasure-house of East and
      West. But it was not Portugal, with her tiny population, and her empire
      that was little more than a line of forts and factories 10,000 miles long,
      nor Spain, for centuries an army on the march, and now staggering beneath
      the responsibilities of her vast and scattered empire, devout to
      fanaticism, and with an incapacity for economic affairs which seemed
      almost inspired, who reaped the material harvest of the empires into which
      they had stepped, the one by patient toil, the other by luck. Gathering
      spoils which they could not retain, and amassing wealth which slipped
      through their fingers, they were little more than the political agents of
      minds more astute and characters better versed in the arts of peace. Every
      period and society has some particular center, or institution, or social
      class, in which the characteristic qualities of its genius seem to be
      fixed and embodied. In the Europe of the early Renaissance the heart of
      the movement had been Italy. In the Europe of the Reformation it was the
      Low Countries. The economic capital of the new civilization was Antwerp.
      The institution which best symbolized its eager economic energies was the
      international money-market and produce-exchange. Its typical figure, the
      paymaster of princes, was the international financier.</p>
      <p>Before it was poisoned by persecution, revolution and war, the spirit
      of the Netherlands found its purest incarnation in Erasmus, a prophet
      without sackcloth and a reformer untouched by heat or fury, to the
      universal internationalism of whose crystal spirit the boundaries of
      States were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> pattern
      scrawled to amuse the childish malice of princes. Of that cosmopolitan
      country, destined to be the refuge of the international idea when outlawed
      by every other power in Europe, Antwerp, “a home common to all nations,”
      was the most cosmopolitan city. Made famous as a center of learning by
      Plantin’s press, the metropolis of painting in a country where painting
      was almost a national industry, it was at once the shrine to which masters
      like Cranach, Dürer and Holbein made their pilgrimage of devotion, and an
      asylum which offered to the refugees of less happy countries a haven as
      yet undisturbed by any systematic campaign to stamp out heresy. In the
      exuberance of its intellectual life, as in the glitter of its material
      prosperity, the thinker and the reformer found a spiritual home, where the
      energies of the new age seemed gathered for a bound into that land of
      happiness and dreams, for the scene of which More, who knew his Europe,
      chose as the least incredible setting the garden of his lodgings at
      Antwerp.</p>
      <p>The economic preëminence of Antwerp owed much to the industrial region
      behind it, from which the woollen and worsteds of Valenciennes and
      Tournai, the tapestries of Brussels and Oudenarde, the iron of Namur, and
      the munitions of the Black Country round Liége, poured in an unceasing
      stream on to its quays.[<a href="#footnote-2-6" id="noteref-2-6">6</a>]
      But Antwerp was a European, rather than a Flemish, metropolis. Long the
      competitor of Bruges for the reception of the two great currents of trade
      from the Mediterranean and the Baltic, which met in the Low Countries, by
      the last quarter of the fifteenth century she had crushed her rival. The
      Hanse League maintained a depôt at Antwerp; Italian banking firms in
      increasing numbers opened businesses there; the English Merchant
      Adventurers made it the entrepôt through which English cloth, long its
      principal import, was distributed to northern Europe; the copper market
      moved from Venice to Antwerp in the nineties. Then came the great
      Discoveries, and Antwerp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
      the first city to tap the wealth, not of an inland sea, but of the ocean,
      stepped into a position of unchallenged preëminence almost unique in
      European history. The long sea-roads which ran east and west met and ended
      in its harbors. The Portuguese Government made it in 1503 the depôt of the
      Eastern spice trade. From the accession of Charles <abbr title="the
      fifth">V</abbr> it was the commercial capital of the Spanish Empire, and,
      in spite of protests that the precious metals were leaving Spain, the
      market for American silver. Commerce, with its demand for cheap and easy
      credit, brought finance in its train. The commercial companies and
      banking-houses of south Germany turned from the dwindling trade across the
      Alps, to make Antwerp the base for financial operations of unexampled
      magnitude and complexity.[<a href="#footnote-2-7"
      id="noteref-2-7">7</a>]</p>
      <p>In such an economic forcing-house new philosophies of society, like new
      religious creeds, found a congenial soil. Professor Pirenne has contrasted
      the outlook of the medieval middle class, intent on the conservation of
      corporate and local privileges, with that of the new plutocracy of the
      sixteenth century, with its international ramifications, its independence
      of merely local interests, its triumphant vindication of the power of the
      capitalist to dispense with the artificial protection of gild and borough
      and carve his own career.[<a href="#footnote-2-8" id="noteref-2-8">8</a>]
      “No one can deny,” wrote the foreign merchants at Antwerp to Philip <abbr
      title="the second">II</abbr>, in protest against an attempt to interfere
      with the liberty of exchange transactions, “that the cause of the
      prosperity of this city is the freedom granted to those who trade
      there.”[<a href="#footnote-2-9" id="noteref-2-9">9</a>] Swept into wealth
      on the crest of a wave of swiftly expanding enterprise, which a century
      before would have seemed the wildest of fantasies, the liberal <i
      lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> of Antwerp pursued, in the teeth of all
      precedents, a policy of practical individualism, which would have been met
      in any other city by rebellion, making terms with the levelling
      encroachments of the Burgundian monarchy, which were fought by their more
      conservative neighbors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
      lowering tariffs and extinguishing private tolls, welcoming the technical
      improvements which elsewhere were resisted, taming the turbulent
      independence of the gilds, and throwing open to alien and citizen alike
      the new Exchange, with its significant dedication: <i lang="la">Ad usum
      mercatorum cuiusque gentis ac linguae.</i></p>
      <p>For, if Antwerp was the microcosm which reflected the soul of
      commercial Europe, the heart of Antwerp was its Bourse. The causes which
      made financial capitalism as characteristic of the age of the Renaissance,
      as industrial capitalism was to be of the nineteenth century, consisted
      partly in the mere expansion in the scale of commercial enterprise. A
      steady flow of capital was needed to finance the movement of the produce
      handled on the world-market, such as the eastern spice crop—above all
      pepper, which the impecunious Portuguese Government sold in bulk, while it
      was still on the water, to German syndicates—copper, alum, the precious
      metals, and the cloth shipped by the English Merchant Adventurers. The
      cheapening of bullion and the rise in prices swelled the profits seeking
      investment; the growth of an international banking system mobilized
      immense resources at the strategic points; and, since Antwerp was the
      capital of the European money-market, the bill on Antwerp was the
      commonest form of international currency. Linked together by the presence
      in each of the great financial houses of the Continent, with liquid funds
      pouring in from mines in Hungary and the Tyrol, trading ventures in the
      East, taxes wrung from Spanish peasants, speculations on the part of
      financiers, and savings invested by the general public, Antwerp, Lyons,
      Frankfurt and Venice, and, in the second rank, Rouen, Paris, Strassburg,
      Seville and London, had developed by the middle of the century a
      considerable class of financial specialists, and a financial technique,
      identical, in all essentials, with that of the present day. They formed
      together the departments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg
      76]</span> an international clearing-house, where bills could be readily
      discounted, drafts on any important city could be obtained, and the paper
      of merchants of almost every nationality changed hands.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-10" id="noteref-2-10">10</a>]</p>
      <p>Nourished by the growth of peaceful commerce, the financial capitalism
      of the age fared not less sumptuously, if more dangerously, at the courts
      of princes. Mankind, it seems, hates nothing so much as its own
      prosperity. Menaced with an accession of riches which would lighten its
      toil, it makes haste to redouble its labors, and to pour away the perilous
      stuff, which might deprive of plausibility the complaint that it is poor.
      Applied to the arts of peace, the new resources commanded by Europe during
      the first half of the sixteenth century might have done something to
      exorcise the specters of pestilence and famine, and to raise the material
      fabric of civilization to undreamed-of heights. Its rulers, secular and
      ecclesiastical alike, thought otherwise. When pestilence and famine were
      ceasing to be necessities imposed by nature, they reëstablished them by
      political art.</p>
      <p>The sluice which they opened to drain away each new accession of
      superfluous wealth was war. “Of all birds,” wrote the sharpest pen of the
      age, “the eagle alone has seemed to wise men the type of royalty—not
      beautiful, not musical, not fit for food, but carnivorous, greedy, hateful
      to all, the curse of all, and, with its great powers of doing harm,
      surpassing them in its desire of doing it.”[<a href="#footnote-2-11"
      id="noteref-2-11">11</a>] The words of Erasmus, uttered in 1517, were only
      too prophetic. For approximately three-quarters both of the sixteenth and
      of the seventeenth centuries, Europe tore itself to pieces. In the course
      of the conflict the spiritual fires of Renaissance and Reformation alike
      were trampled out beneath the feet of bravos as malicious and mischievous
      as the vain, bloody-minded and futile generals who strut and posture, to
      the hateful laughter of Thersites, in the most despairing<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> of Shakespeare’s tragedies. By
      the middle of the sixteenth century the English Government, after an orgy
      of debasement and confiscation, was in a state of financial collapse, and
      by the end of it Spain, the southern Netherlands including Antwerp, and a
      great part of France, including the financial capital of southern Europe,
      Lyons, were ruined. By the middle of the seventeenth century wide tracts
      of Germany were a desert, and by the end of it the French finances had
      relapsed into worse confusion than that from which they had been
      temporarily rescued by the genius of Colbert. The victors compared their
      position with that of the vanquished, and congratulated themselves on
      their spoils. It rarely occurred to them to ask what it would have been,
      had there been neither victors nor vanquished, but only peace.</p>
      <p>It is possible that the bankruptcies of Governments have, on the whole,
      done less harm to mankind than their ability to raise loans, and the
      mobilization of economic power on a scale unknown before armed the fierce
      nationalism of the age with a weapon more deadly than gunpowder and
      cannon. The centralized States which were rising in the age of the
      Renaissance were everywhere faced with a desperate financial situation. It
      sprang from the combination of modern administrative and military methods
      with medieval systems of finance. They entrusted to bureaucracies work
      which, if done at all, had formerly been done as an incident of tenure, or
      by boroughs and gilds; officials had to be paid. They were constantly at
      war; and the new technique of war, involving the use of masses of
      professional infantry and artillery—which Rabelais said was invented by
      the inspiration of the devil, as a counterpoise to the invention of
      printing inspired by God—was making it, as after 1870, a highly
      capitalized industry. Government after Government, undeterred, with rare
      exceptions, by the disasters of its neighbors, trod a familiar round of
      expedients, each of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
      was more disastrous than the last. They hoarded treasure, only to see the
      accumulations of a thrifty Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr> or
      Frederick <abbr title="the third">III</abbr> dissipated by a Henry <abbr
      title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> or a Maximilian. They debased the currency
      and ruined trade. They sold offices, or established monopolies, and
      crushed the taxpayer beneath a load of indirect taxation. They plundered
      the Church, and spent gorgeously as income property which should have been
      treated as capital. They parted with Crown estates, and left an insoluble
      problem to their successors.</p>
      <p>These agreeable devices had, however, obvious limits. What remained,
      when they were exhausted, was the money-market, and to the rulers of the
      money-market sooner or later all States came. Their dependence on the
      financier was that of an Ismail or an Abdul, and its results were not less
      disastrous. Naturally, the City interest was one of the great Powers of
      Europe. Publicists might write that the new Messiah was the Prince, and
      reformers that the Prince was Pope. But behind Prince and Pope alike,
      financing impartially Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>, Edward
      <abbr title="the sixth">VI</abbr> and Elizabeth, Francis, Charles and
      Philip, stood in the last resort a little German banker, with branches in
      every capital in Europe, who played in the world of finance the part of
      the <i lang="la">condottieri</i> in war, and represented in the economic
      sphere the morality typified in that of politics by Machiavelli’s Prince.
      Compared with these financial dynasties, Hapsburgs, Valois and Tudors were
      puppets dancing on wires held by a money-power to which political
      struggles were irrelevant except as an opportunity for gain.</p>
      <p>The financier received his payment partly in cash, partly in
      concessions, which still further elaborated the network of financial
      connections that were making Europe an economic unity. The range of
      interests in which the German banking-houses were involved is astonishing.
      The Welsers had invested in the Portuguese voyage of 1505 to the East
      Indies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> financed an
      expedition, half commercial, half military, to Venezuela in 1527, were
      engaged in the spice trade between Lisbon, Antwerp and south Germany, were
      partners in silver and copper mines in the Tyrol and Hungary, and had
      establishments, not only at Lisbon and Antwerp, but in the principal
      cities of Germany, Italy and Switzerland. The careers of the Hochstetters,
      Haugs, Meutings and Imhofs were much the same. The Fuggers, thanks to
      judicious loans to Maximilian, had acquired enormous concessions of
      mineral property, farmed a large part of the receipts drawn by the Spanish
      Crown from its estates, held silver and quicksilver mines in Spain, and
      controlled banking and commercial businesses in Italy, and, above all, at
      Antwerp. They advanced the money which made Albrecht of Brandenburg
      archbishop of Mainz; repaid themselves by sending their agent to accompany
      Tetzel on his campaign to raise money by indulgences and taking half the
      proceeds; provided the funds with which Charles <abbr title="the
      fifth">V</abbr> bought the imperial crown, after an election conducted
      with the publicity of an auction and the morals of a gambling hell;
      browbeat him, when the debt was not paid, in the tone of a pawnbroker
      rating a necessitous client; and found the money with which Charles raised
      troops to fight the Protestants in 1552. The head of the firm built a
      church and endowed an almshouse for the aged poor in his native town of
      Augsburg. He died in the odor of sanctity, a good Catholic and a Count of
      the Empire, having seen his firm pay 54 per cent. for the preceding
      sixteen years.[<a href="#footnote-2-12" id="noteref-2-12">12</a>]</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-2-2"><abbr title="2">II</abbr>. LUTHER</h3>
      <p>Like the rise of the great industry three centuries later, the economic
      revolution which accompanied the Renaissance gave a powerful stimulus to
      speculation. Both in Germany and in England, the Humanists turned a stream
      of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span> pungent criticism on
      the social evils of their age. Mercantilist thinkers resharpened an old
      economic weapon for the armory of princes. Objective economic analysis,
      still in its infancy, received a new impetus from the controversies of
      practical men on the rise in prices, on currency, and on the foreign
      exchanges.</p>
      <p>The question of the attitude which religious opinion would assume
      towards these new forces was momentous. It might hail the outburst of
      economic enterprise as an instrument of wealth and luxury, like the Popes
      who revelled in the rediscovery of classical culture. It might denounce it
      as a relapse into a pagan immorality, like the Fathers who had turned with
      a shudder from the material triumphs of Rome. It might attempt to harness
      the expanding energies to its own conception of man’s spiritual end, like
      the Schoolmen who had stretched old formulæ to cover the new forces of
      capital and commerce. It could hardly ignore them. For, in spite of
      Machiavelli, social theory was only beginning to emancipate itself from
      the stiff ecclesiastical framework of the Middle Ages. The most systematic
      treatment of economic questions was still that contained in the work of
      canonists, and divines continued to pronounce judgment on problems of
      property and contract with the same assurance as on problems of
      theology.</p>
      <p>Laymen might dispute the content of their teaching and defy its
      conclusions. But it was rarely, as yet, that they attacked the assumption
      that questions of economic conduct belonged to the province of the
      ecclesiastical jurist. Bellarmin complained with some asperity of the
      intolerable complexity of the problems of economic casuistry which pious
      merchants propounded in the confessional. The Spanish dealers on the
      Antwerp Bourse, a class not morbidly prone to conscientious scruples, were
      sufficiently deferential to ecclesiastical authority to send their
      confessor to Paris in order to consult the theologians of the University
      as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> compatibility
      of speculative exchange business with the canon law.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-13" id="noteref-2-13">13</a>] When Eck, later famous as
      the champion who crossed swords with Luther, travelled to Italy, in order
      to seek from the University of Bologna authoritative confirmation of his
      daring argument that interest could lawfully be charged in transactions
      between merchants, no less a group of capitalists than the great house of
      Fugger thought it worth while to finance an expedition undertaken in quest
      of so profitable a truth.[<a href="#footnote-2-14"
      id="noteref-2-14">14</a>]</p>
      <p>Individualistic, competitive, swept forward by an immense expansion of
      commerce and finance, rather than of industry, and offering opportunities
      of speculative gain on a scale unknown before, the new economic
      civilization inevitably gave rise to passionate controversy; and
      inevitably, since both the friends and the enemies of the Reformation
      identified it with social change, the leaders in the religious struggle
      were the protagonists in the debate. In Germany, where social revolution
      had been fermenting for half a century, it seemed at last to have come.
      The rise in prices, an enigma which baffled contemporaries till Bodin
      published his celebrated tract in 1569,[<a href="#footnote-2-15"
      id="noteref-2-15">15</a>] produced a storm of indignation against
      monopolists. Since the rising led by Hans Böheim in 1476, hardly a decade
      had passed without a peasants’ revolt. Usury, long a grievance with
      craftsman and peasant, had become a battle-cry. From city after city
      municipal authorities, terrified by popular demands for the repression of
      the extortioner, consulted universities and divines as to the legitimacy
      of interest, and universities and divines gave, as is their wont, a loud,
      but confused, response. Melanchthon expounded godly doctrine on the
      subject of money-lending and prices.[<a href="#footnote-2-16"
      id="noteref-2-16">16</a>] Calvin wrote a famous letter on usury and
      delivered sermons on the same subject.[<a href="#footnote-2-17"
      id="noteref-2-17">17</a>] Bucer sketched a scheme of social reconstruction
      for a Christian prince.[<a href="#footnote-2-18" id="noteref-2-18">18</a>]
      Bullinger produced a classical exposition of social ethics in the
      <i>Decades</i> which he dedicated to Edward <abbr title="the
      sixth">VI</abbr>.[<a href="#footnote-2-19" id="noteref-2-19">19</a>]<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span> Luther preached and
      pamphleteered against extortioners,[<a href="#footnote-2-20"
      id="noteref-2-20">20</a>] and said that it was time “to put a bit in the
      mouth of the holy company of the Fuggers.”[<a href="#footnote-2-21"
      id="noteref-2-21">21</a>] Zwingli and Œcolampadius devised plans for the
      reorganization of poor relief.[<a href="#footnote-2-22"
      id="noteref-2-22">22</a>] Above all, the Peasants’ War, with its touching
      appeal to the Gospel and its frightful catastrophe, not only terrified
      Luther into his outburst: “Whoso can, strike, smite, strangle, or stab,
      secretly or publicly ... such wonderful times are these that a prince can
      better merit Heaven with bloodshed than another with prayer”;[<a
      href="#footnote-2-23" id="noteref-2-23">23</a>] it also helped to stamp on
      Lutheranism an almost servile reliance on the secular authorities. In
      England there was less violence, but hardly less agitation, and a similar
      flood of writing and preaching. Latimer, Ponet, Crowley, Lever, Becon,
      Sandys and Jewel—to mention but the best-known names—all contributed to
      the debate.[<a href="#footnote-2-24" id="noteref-2-24">24</a>] Whatever
      the social practice of the sixteenth century may have been, it did not
      suffer for lack of social teaching on the part of men of religion. If the
      world could be saved by sermons and pamphlets, it would have been a
      Paradise.</p>
      <p>That the problems of a swiftly changing economic environment should
      have burst on Europe at a moment when it was torn by religious dissensions
      more acute than ever before, may perhaps be counted as not least among the
      tragedies of its history. But differences of social theory did not
      coincide with differences of religious opinion, and the mark of nearly all
      this body of teaching, alike in Germany and in England, is its
      conservatism. Where questions of social morality were involved, men whose
      names are a symbol of religious revolution stood, with hardly an
      exception, on the ancient ways, appealed to medieval authorities, and
      reproduced in popular language the doctrines of the Schoolmen.</p>
      <p>A view of the social history of the sixteenth century which has found
      acceptance in certain quarters has represented<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> the Reformation as the triumph of the
      commercial spirit over the traditional social ethics of Christendom.
      Something like it is of respectable antiquity. As early as 1540 Cranmer
      wrote to Oziander protesting against the embarrassment caused to reformers
      in England by the indulgence to moral laxity, in the matter alike of
      economic transactions and of marriage, alleged to be given by reformers in
      Germany.[<a href="#footnote-2-25" id="noteref-2-25">25</a>] By the
      seventeenth century the hints had become a theory and an argument. Bossuet
      taunted Calvin and Bucer with being the first theologians to defend
      extortion,[<a href="#footnote-2-26" id="noteref-2-26">26</a>] and it only
      remained for a pamphleteer to adapt the indictment to popular consumption,
      by writing bluntly that “it grew to a proverb that usury was the brat of
      heresy.”[<a href="#footnote-2-27" id="noteref-2-27">27</a>] That the
      revolt from Rome synchronized, both in Germany and in England, with a
      period of acute social distress is undeniable, nor is any long argument
      needed to show that, like other revolutions, it had its seamy side. What
      is sometimes suggested, however, is not merely a coincidence of religious
      and economic movements, but a logical connection between changes in
      economic organization and changes in religious doctrines. It is implied
      that the bad social practice of the age was the inevitable expression of
      its religious innovations, and that, if the reformers did not explicitly
      teach a conscienceless individualism, individualism was, at least, the
      natural corollary of their teaching. In the eighteenth century, which had
      as little love for the commercial restrictions of the ages of monkish
      superstition as for their political theory, that view was advanced as
      eulogy. In our own day, the wheel seems almost to have come full circle.
      What was then a matter for congratulation is now often an occasion for
      criticism. There are writers by whom the Reformation is attacked, as
      inaugurating a period of unscrupulous commercialism, which had previously
      been held in check, it is suggested, by the teaching of the Church.</p>
      <p>These attempts to relate changes in social theory to the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
      grand religious struggles of the age have their significance. But the <i
      lang="la">obiter dicta</i> of an acrimonious controversy throw more light
      on the temper of the combatants than on the substance of their
      contentions, and the issues were too complex to be adequately expressed in
      the simple antitheses which appealed to partisans. If capitalism means the
      direction of industry by the owners of capital for their own pecuniary
      gain, and the social relationships which establish themselves between them
      and the wage-earning proletariat whom they control, then capitalism had
      existed on a grand scale both in medieval Italy and in medieval Flanders.
      If by the capitalist spirit is meant the temper which is prepared to
      sacrifice all moral scruples to the pursuit of profit, it had been only
      too familiar to the saints and sages of the Middle Ages. It was the
      economic imperialism of Catholic Portugal and Spain, not the less
      imposing, if more solid, achievements of the Protestant powers, which
      impressed contemporaries down to the Armada. It was predominantly Catholic
      cities which were the commercial capitals of Europe, and Catholic bankers
      who were its leading financiers.</p>
      <p>Nor is the suggestion that Protestant opinion looked with indulgence on
      the temper which attacked restraints on economic enterprise better
      founded. If it is true that the Reformation released forces which were to
      act as a solvent of the traditional attitude of religious thought to
      social and economic issues, it did so without design, and against the
      intention of most reformers. In reality, however sensational the
      innovations in economic practice which accompanied the expansion of
      financial capitalism in the sixteenth century, the development of doctrine
      on the subject of economic ethics was continuous, and, the more closely it
      is examined, the less foundation does there seem to be for the view that
      the stream plunged into vacancy over the precipice of the religious
      revolution. To think of the abdication of<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> religion from its theoretical primacy over
      economic activity and social institutions as synchronizing with the revolt
      from Rome, is to antedate a movement which was not finally accomplished
      for another century and a half, and which owed as much to changes in
      economic and political organization, as it did to developments in the
      sphere of religious thought. In the sixteenth century religious teachers
      of all shades of opinion still searched the Bible, the Fathers and the <i
      lang="la">Corpus Juris Canonici</i> for light on practical questions of
      social morality, and, as far as the first generation of reformers was
      concerned, there was no intention, among either Lutherans, or Calvinists,
      or Anglicans, of relaxing the rules of good conscience, which were
      supposed to control economic transactions and social relations. If
      anything, indeed, their tendency was to interpret them with a more
      rigorous severity, as a protest against the moral laxity of the
      Renaissance, and, in particular, against the avarice which was thought to
      be peculiarly the sin of Rome. For the passion for regeneration and
      purification, which was one element in the Reformation, was directed
      against the corruptions of society as well as of the Church. Princes and
      nobles and business men conducted themselves after their kind, and fished
      eagerly in troubled waters. But the aim of religious leaders was to
      reconstruct, not merely doctrine and ecclesiastical government, but
      conduct and institutions, on a pattern derived from the forgotten purity
      of primitive Christianity.</p>
      <p>The appeal from the depravity of the present to a golden age of
      pristine innocence found at once its most vehement, and its most artless,
      expression in the writings of the German reformers. Like the return to
      nature in the eighteenth century, it was the cry for spiritual peace of a
      society disillusioned with the material triumphs of a too complex
      civilization. The prosperity of Augsburg, Nürnberg, Regensburg, Ulm and
      Frankfurt, and even of lesser cities like<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> Rotenburg and Freiburg, had long been the
      admiration of all observers. Commanding the great trade routes across the
      Alps and down the Rhine, they had held a central position, which they were
      to lose when the spice trade moved to Antwerp and Lisbon, and were not to
      recover till the creation of a railway system in the nineteenth century
      made Germany again the entrepôt between western Europe and Russia,
      Austria, Italy and the near East. But the expansion of commerce, which
      brought affluence to the richer <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, had been
      accompanied by the growth of an acute social <i lang="fr">malaise</i>,
      which left its mark on literature and popular agitation, even before the
      Discoveries turned Germany from a highway into a back-water. The economic
      aspect of the development was the rise to a position of overwhelming
      preëminence of the new interests based on the control of capital and
      credit. In the earlier Middle Ages capital had been the adjunct and ally
      of the personal labor of craftsman and artisan. In the Germany of the
      fifteenth century, as long before in Italy, it had ceased to be a servant
      and had become a master. Assuming a separate and independent vitality, it
      claimed the right of a predominant partner to dictate economic
      organization in accordance with its own exacting requirements.</p>
      <p>Under the impact of these new forces, while the institutions of earlier
      ages survived in form, their spirit and operation were transformed. In the
      larger cities the gild organization, once a barrier to the encroachments
      of the capitalist, became one of the instruments which he used to
      consolidate his power. The rules of fraternities masked a division of the
      brethren into a plutocracy of merchants, sheltered behind barriers which
      none but the wealthy craftsman could scale, and a wage-earning
      proletariat, dependent for their livelihood on capital and credit supplied
      by their masters, and alternately rising in revolt and sinking in an
      ever-expanding morass of hopeless pauperism.[<a href="#footnote-2-28"
      id="noteref-2-28">28</a>] The peasantry<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> suffered equally from the spread of a
      commercial civilization into the rural districts and from the survival of
      ancient agrarian servitudes. As in England, the <i lang="fr">nouveaux
      riches</i> of the towns invested money in land by purchase and loan, and
      drove up rents and fines by their competition. But, while in England the
      customary tenant was shaking off the onerous obligations of villeinage,
      and appealing, not without success, to the royal courts to protect his
      title, his brother in south Germany, where serfdom was to last till the
      middle of the nineteenth century, found <i lang="fr">corvées</i>
      redoubled, money-payments increased, and common rights curtailed, for the
      benefit of an impoverished <i lang="fr">noblesse</i>, which saw in the
      exploitation of the peasant the only means of maintaining its social
      position in face of the rapidly growing wealth of the <i
      lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, and which seized on the now fashionable Roman
      law as an instrument to give legal sanction to its harshest exactions.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-29" id="noteref-2-29">29</a>]</p>
      <p>On a society thus distracted by the pains of growth came the commercial
      revolution produced by the Discoveries. Their effect was to open a
      seemingly limitless field to economic enterprise, and to sharpen the edge
      of every social problem. Unable henceforward to tap through Venice the
      wealth of the East, the leading commercial houses of south Germany either
      withdrew from the trade across the Alps, to specialize, like the Fuggers,
      in banking and finance, or organized themselves into companies, which
      handled at Lisbon and Antwerp a trade too distant and too expensive to be
      undertaken by individual merchants using only their own resources. The
      modern world has seen in America the swift rise of combinations
      controlling output and prices by the power of massed capital. A somewhat
      similar movement took place on the narrower stage of European commerce in
      the generation before the Reformation. Its center was Germany, and it was
      defended and attacked by arguments almost identical with those which are
      familiar today.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span> The
      exactions of rings and monopolies, which bought in bulk, drove weaker
      competitors out of the field, “as a great pike swallows up a lot of little
      fishes,” and plundered the consumer, were the commonplaces of the social
      reformer.[<a href="#footnote-2-30" id="noteref-2-30">30</a>] The
      advantages of large-scale organization and the danger of interfering with
      freedom of enterprise were urged by the companies. The problem was on
      several occasions brought before the Imperial Diet. But the discovery of
      the sage who observed that it is not possible to unscramble eggs had
      already been made, and its decrees, passed in the teeth of strenuous
      opposition from the interests concerned, do not seem to have been more
      effective than modern legislation on the same subject.</p>
      <p>The passionate anti-capitalist reaction which such conditions produced
      found expression in numerous schemes of social reconstruction, from the
      so-called <i>Reformation of the Emperor Sigismund</i> in the thirties of
      the fifteenth century, to the <i>Twelve Articles</i> of the peasants in
      1525.[<a href="#footnote-2-31" id="noteref-2-31">31</a>] In the age of the
      Reformation it was voiced by Hipler, who, in his <i>Divine Evangelical
      Reformation</i>, urged that all merchants’ companies, such as those of the
      Fuggers, Hochstetters and Welsers, should be abolished; by Hutten, who
      classed merchants with knights, lawyers and the clergy as public robbers;
      by Geiler von Kaiserberg, who wrote that the monopolists were more
      detestable than Jews, and should be exterminated like wolves; and, above
      all, by Luther.[<a href="#footnote-2-32" id="noteref-2-32">32</a>]</p>
      <p>Luther’s utterances on social morality are the occasional explosions of
      a capricious volcano, with only a rare flash of light amid the torrent of
      smoke and flame, and it is idle to scan them for a coherent and consistent
      doctrine. Compared with the lucid and subtle rationalism of a thinker like
      <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antonino, his sermons and pamphlets on
      social questions make an impression of naïveté, as of an impetuous but
      ill-informed genius, dispensing with the cumbrous embarrassments of law
      and logic, to evolve a system of social<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> ethics from the inspired heat of his own
      unsophisticated consciousness.</p>
      <p>It was partly that they were <i lang="fr">pièces de circonstance</i>,
      thrown off in the storm of a revolution, partly that it was precisely the
      refinements of law and logic which Luther detested. Confronted with the
      complexities of foreign trade and financial organization, or with the
      subtleties of economic analysis, he is like a savage introduced to a
      dynamo or a steam-engine. He is too frightened and angry even to feel
      curiosity. Attempts to explain the mechanism merely enrage him; he can
      only repeat that there is a devil in it, and that good Christians will not
      meddle with the mystery of iniquity. But there is a method in his fury. It
      sprang, not from ignorance, for he was versed in scholastic philosophy,
      but from a conception which made the learning of the schools appear
      trivial or mischievous.</p>
      <p>“Gold,” wrote Columbus, as one enunciating a truism, “constitutes
      treasure, and he who possesses it has all he needs in this world, as also
      the means of rescuing souls from Purgatory, and restoring them to the
      enjoyment of Paradise.”[<a href="#footnote-2-33" id="noteref-2-33">33</a>]
      It was this doctrine that all things have their price—future salvation as
      much as present felicity—which scandalized men who could not be suspected
      of disloyalty to the Church, and which gave their most powerful argument
      to the reformers. Their outlook on society had this in common with their
      outlook on religion, that the essence of both was the arraignment of a
      degenerate civilization before the majestic bar of an uncorrupted past. Of
      that revolutionary conservatism Luther, who hated the economic
      individualism of the age not less than its spiritual laxity, is the
      supreme example. His attitude to the conquest of society by the merchant
      and financier is the same as his attitude towards the commercialization of
      religion. When he looks at the Church in Germany, he sees it sucked dry by
      the tribute which flows to the new Babylon. When he looks at<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> German social life, he finds
      it ridden by a conscienceless money-power, which incidentally ministers,
      like the banking business of the Fuggers, to the avarice and corruption of
      Rome. The exploitation of the Church by the Papacy, and the exploitation
      of the peasant and the craftsman by the capitalist, are thus two horns of
      the beast which sits on the seven hills. Both are essentially pagan, and
      the sword which will slay both is the same. It is the religion of the
      Gospel. The Church must cease to be an empire, and become a congregation
      of believers. Renouncing the prizes and struggles which make the heart
      sick, society must be converted into a band of brothers, performing in
      patient cheerfulness the round of simple toil which is the common lot of
      the descendants of Adam.</p>
      <p>The children of the mind are like the children of the body. Once born,
      they grow by a law of their own being, and, if their parents could foresee
      their future development, it would sometimes break their hearts. Luther,
      who has earned eulogy and denunciation as the grand individualist, would
      have been horrified, could he have anticipated the remoter deductions to
      be derived from his argument. Wamba said that to forgive as a Christian is
      not to forgive at all, and a cynic who urged that the Christian freedom
      expounded by Luther imposed more social restraints than it removed would
      have more affinity with the thought of Luther himself, than the
      libertarian who saw in his teaching a plea for treating questions of
      economic conduct and social organization as spiritually indifferent.
      Luther’s revolt against authority was an attack, not on its rigor, but on
      its laxity and its corruption. His individualism was not the greed of the
      plutocrat, eager to snatch from the weakness of public authority an
      opportunity for personal gain. It was the ingenuous enthusiasm of the
      anarchist, who hungers for a society in which order and fraternity will
      reign without “the tedious, stale, forbidding ways of custom, law<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> and statute,” because they
      well up in all their native purity from the heart.</p>
      <p>Professor Troeltsch has pointed out that Protestants, not less than
      Catholics, emphasized the idea of a Church-civilization, in which all
      departments of life, the State and society, education and science, law,
      commerce and industry, were to be regulated in accordance with the law of
      God.[<a href="#footnote-2-34" id="noteref-2-34">34</a>] That conception
      dominates all the utterances of Luther on social issues. So far from
      accepting the view which was afterwards to prevail, that the world of
      business is a closed compartment with laws of its own, and that the
      religious teacher exceeds his commission when he lays down rules for the
      moral conduct of secular affairs, he reserves for that plausible heresy
      denunciations hardly less bitter than those directed against Rome. The
      text of his admonitions is always, “Unless your righteousness exceeds that
      of the Scribes and Pharisees,” and his appeal is from a formal,
      legalistic, calculated virtue to the natural kindliness which does not
      need to be organized by law, because it is the spontaneous expression of a
      habit of love. To restore is to destroy. The comment on Luther’s
      enthusiasm for the simple Christian virtues of an age innocent of the
      artificial chicaneries of ecclesiastical and secular jurisprudence came in
      the thunder of revolution. It was the declaration of the peasants, that
      “the message of Christ, the promised Messiah, the word of life, teaching
      only love, peace, patience and concord,” was incompatible with serfdom,
      <i lang="fr">corvées</i>, and enclosures.[<a href="#footnote-2-35"
      id="noteref-2-35">35</a>]</p>
      <p>The practical conclusion to which such premises led was a theory of
      society more medieval than that held by many thinkers in the Middle Ages,
      since it dismissed the commercial developments of the last two centuries
      as a relapse into paganism. The foundation of it was partly the Bible,
      partly a vague conception of a state of nature in which men had not yet
      been corrupted by riches, partly the popular protests<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> against a commercial civilization which were
      everywhere in the air, and which Luther, a man of the people, absorbed and
      reproduced with astonishing naïveté, even while he denounced the practical
      measures proposed to give effect to them. Like some elements in the
      Catholic reaction of the twentieth century, the Protestant reaction of the
      sixteenth sighed for a vanished age of peasant prosperity. The social
      theory of Luther, who hated commerce and capitalism, has its nearest
      modern analogy in the Distributive State of Mr. Belloc and Mr.
      Chesterton.</p>
      <p>For the arts by which men amass wealth and power, as for the anxious
      provision which accumulates for the future, Luther had all the distrust of
      a peasant and a monk. Christians should earn their living in the sweat of
      their brow, take no thought for the morrow, marry young and trust Heaven
      to provide for its own. Like Melanchthon, Luther thought that the most
      admirable life was that of the peasant, for it was least touched by the
      corroding spirit of commercial calculation, and he quoted Virgil to drive
      home the lesson to be derived from the example of the patriarchs.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-36" id="noteref-2-36">36</a>] The labor of the craftsman
      is honorable, for he serves the community in his calling; the honest smith
      or shoemaker is a priest. Trade is permissible, provided that it is
      confined to the exchange of necessaries, and that the seller demands no
      more than will compensate him for his labor and risk. The unforgivable
      sins are idleness and covetousness, for they destroy the unity of the body
      of which Christians are members. The grand author and maintainer of both
      is Rome. For, having ruined Italy, the successor of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
      Peter, who lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal, has
      fastened his fangs on Germany; while the mendicant orders, mischievous
      alike in their practice and by their example, cover the land with a horde
      of beggars. Pilgrimages, saints’ days and monasteries are an excuse for
      idleness and must be suppressed. Vagrants must be either banished<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> or compelled to labor, and
      each town must organize charity for the support of the honest poor.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-37" id="noteref-2-37">37</a>]</p>
      <p>Luther accepted the social hierarchy, with its principles of status and
      subordination, though he knocked away the ecclesiastical rungs in the
      ladder. The combination of religious radicalism and economic conservatism
      is not uncommon, and in the traditional conception of society, as an
      organism of unequal classes with different rights and functions, the
      father of all later revolutions found an arsenal of arguments against
      change, which he launched with almost equal fury against revolting
      peasants and grasping monopolists. His vindication of the spiritual
      freedom of common men, and his outspoken abuse of the German princes, had
      naturally been taken at their face value by serfs groaning under an odious
      tyranny, and, when the inevitable rising came, the rage of Luther, like
      that of Burke in another age, was sharpened by embarrassment at what
      seemed to him a hideous parody of truths which were both sacred and his
      own. As fully convinced as any medieval writer that serfdom was the
      necessary foundation of society, his alarm at the attempt to abolish it
      was intensified by a political theory which exalted the absolutism of
      secular authorities, and a religious doctrine which drew a sharp
      antithesis between the external order and the life of the spirit. The
      demand of the peasants that villeinage should end, because “Christ has
      delivered and redeemed us all, the lowly as well as the great, without
      exception, by the shedding of His precious blood,”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-38" id="noteref-2-38">38</a>] horrified him, partly as
      portending an orgy of anarchy, partly because it was likely to be confused
      with and to prejudice, as in fact it did, the Reformation movement, partly
      because (as he thought) it degraded the Gospel by turning a spiritual
      message into a program of social reconstruction. “This article would make
      all men equal and so change the spiritual kingdom of Christ into an
      external worldly one. Impossible! An earthly kingdom cannot<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> exist without inequality of
      persons. Some must be free, others serfs, some rulers, others subjects. As
      <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul says, ‘Before Christ both master and
      slave are one.’”[<a href="#footnote-2-39" id="noteref-2-39">39</a>] After
      nearly four centuries, Luther’s apprehensions of a too hasty establishment
      of the Kingdom of Heaven appear somewhat exaggerated.</p>
      <p>A society may perish by corruption as well as by violence. Where the
      peasants battered, the capitalist mined; and Luther, whose ideal was the
      patriarchal ethics of a world which, if it ever existed, was visibly
      breaking up, had as little mercy for the slow poison of commerce and
      finance as for the bludgeon of revolt. No contrast could be more striking
      than that between his social theory and the outlook of Calvin. Calvin,
      with all his rigor, accepted the main institutions of a commercial
      civilization, and supplied a creed to the classes which were to dominate
      the future. The eyes of Luther were on the past. He saw no room in a
      Christian society for those middle classes whom an English statesman once
      described as the natural representatives of the human race. International
      trade, banking and credit, capitalist industry, the whole complex of
      economic forces, which, next to his own revolution, were to be the
      mightiest solvent of the medieval world, seem to him to belong in their
      very essence to the kingdom of darkness which the Christian will shun. He
      attacks the authority of the canon law, only to reaffirm more dogmatically
      the detailed rules which it had been used to enforce. When he discusses
      economic questions at length, as in his <i>Long Sermon on Usury</i> in
      1520, or his tract <i>On Trade and Usury</i> in 1524, his doctrines are
      drawn from the straitest interpretation of ecclesiastical jurisprudence,
      unsoftened by the qualifications with which canonists themselves had
      attempted to adapt its rigors to the exigencies of practical life.</p>
      <p>In the matter of prices he merely rehearses traditional<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
      doctrines. “A man should not say, ‘I will sell my wares as dear as I can
      or please,’ but ‘I will sell my wares as is right and proper.’ For thy
      selling should not be a work that is within thy own power or will, without
      all law and limit, as though thou wert a God, bounden to no one. But
      because thy selling is a work that thou performest to thy neighbor, it
      should be restrained within such law and conscience that thou mayest
      practice it without harm or injury to him.”[<a href="#footnote-2-40"
      id="noteref-2-40">40</a>] If a price is fixed by public authority, the
      seller must keep to it. If it is not, he must follow the price of common
      estimation. If he has to determine it himself, he must consider the income
      needed to maintain him in his station in life, his labor, and his risk,
      and must settle it accordingly. He must not take advantage of scarcity to
      raise it. He must not corner the market. He must not deal in futures. He
      must not sell dearer for deferred payments.</p>
      <p>On the subject of usury, Luther goes even further than the orthodox
      teaching. He denounces the concessions to practical necessities made by
      the canonists. “The greatest misfortune of the German nation is easily the
      traffic in interest.... The devil invented it, and the Pope, by giving his
      sanction to it, has done untold evil throughout the world.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-41" id="noteref-2-41">41</a>] Not content with insisting
      that lending ought to be free, he denounces the payment of interest as
      compensation for loss and the practice of investing in rent-charges, both
      of which the canon law in his day allowed, and would refuse usurers the
      sacrament, absolution, and Christian burial. With such a code of ethics,
      Luther naturally finds the characteristic developments of his
      generation—the luxury trade with the East, international finance,
      speculation on the exchanges, combinations and monopolies—shocking beyond
      measure. “Foreign merchandise which brings from Calicut and India and the
      like places wares such as precious silver and jewels and spices ... and
      drain the land and people of their money, should not be permitted.... Of
      combinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> I ought
      really to say much, but the matter is endless and bottomless, full of mere
      greed and wrong.... Who is so stupid as not to see that combinations are
      mere outright monopolies, which even heathen civil laws—I will say nothing
      of divine right and Christian law—condemn as a plainly harmful thing in
      all the world?”[<a href="#footnote-2-42" id="noteref-2-42">42</a>]</p>
      <p>So resolute an enemy of license might have been expected to be the
      champion of law. It might have been supposed that Luther, with his hatred
      of the economic appetites, would have hailed as an ally the restraints by
      which, at least in theory, those appetites had been controlled. In
      reality, of course, his attitude towards the mechanism of ecclesiastical
      jurisprudence and discipline was the opposite. It was one, not merely of
      indifference, but of repugnance. The prophet who scourged with whips the
      cupidity of the individual chastised with scorpions the restrictions
      imposed upon it by society; the apostle of an ideal ethic of Christian
      love turned a shattering dialectic on the corporate organization of the
      Christian Church. In most ages, so tragic a parody of human hopes are
      human institutions, there have been some who have loved mankind, while
      hating almost everything that men have done or made. Of that temper
      Luther, who lived at a time when the contrast between a sublime theory and
      a hideous reality had long been intolerable, is the supreme example. He
      preaches a selfless charity, but he recoils with horror from every
      institution by which an attempt had been made to give it a concrete
      expression. He reiterates the content of medieval economic teaching with a
      literalness rarely to be found in the thinkers of the later Middle Ages,
      but for the rules and ordinances in which it had received a positive, if
      sadly imperfect, expression, he has little but abhorrence. God speaks to
      the soul, not through the mediation of the priesthood or of social
      institutions built up by man, but <i lang="la">solus cum solo</i>, as a
      voice in the heart and in the heart alone. Thus the bridges between<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> the worlds of spirit and of
      sense are broken, and the soul is isolated from the society of men, that
      it may enter into communion with its Maker. The grace that is freely
      bestowed upon it may overflow in its social relations; but those relations
      can supply no particle of spiritual nourishment to make easier the
      reception of grace. Like the primeval confusion into which the fallen
      Angel plunged on his fatal mission, they are a chaos of brute matter, a
      wilderness of dry bones, a desert unsanctified and incapable of
      contributing to sanctification. “It is certain that absolutely none among
      outward things, under whatever name they may be reckoned, has any
      influence in producing Christian righteousness or liberty.... One thing,
      and one alone, is necessary for life, justification and Christian liberty;
      and that is the most holy word of God, the Gospel of Christ.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-43" id="noteref-2-43">43</a>]</p>
      <p>The difference between loving men as a result of first loving God, and
      learning to love God through a growing love for men, may not, at first
      sight, appear profound. To Luther it seemed an abyss, and Luther was
      right. It was, in a sense, nothing less than the Reformation itself. For
      carried, as it was not carried by Luther, to its logical result, the
      argument made, not only good works, but sacraments and the Church itself
      unnecessary. The question of the religious significance of that change of
      emphasis, and of the validity of the intellectual processes by which
      Luther reached his conclusions, is one for theologians. Its effects on
      social theory were staggering. Since salvation is bestowed by the
      operation of grace in the heart and by that alone, the whole fabric of
      organized religion, which had mediated between the individual soul and its
      Maker—divinely commissioned hierarchy, systematized activities, corporate
      institutions—drops away, as the blasphemous trivialities of a religion of
      works. The medieval conception of the social order, which had regarded it
      as a highly articulated organism of members contributing in their
      different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span> degrees to a
      spiritual purpose, was shattered, and differences which had been
      distinctions within a larger unity were now set in irreconcilable
      antagonism to each other. Grace no longer completed nature: it was the
      antithesis of it. Man’s actions as a member of society were no longer the
      extension of his life as a child of God: they were its negation. Secular
      interests ceased to possess, even remotely, a religious significance: they
      might compete with religion, but they could not enrich it. Detailed rules
      of conduct—a Christian casuistry—are needless or objectionable: the
      Christian has a sufficient guide in the Bible and in his own conscience.
      In one sense, the distinction between the secular and the religious life
      vanished. Monasticism was, so to speak, secularized; all men stood
      henceforward on the same footing towards God; and that advance, which
      contained the germ of all subsequent revolutions, was so enormous that all
      else seems insignificant. In another sense, the distinction became more
      profound than ever before. For, though all might be sanctified, it was
      their inner life alone which could partake of sanctification. The world
      was divided into good and evil, light and darkness, spirit and matter. The
      division between them was absolute; no human effort could span the
      chasm.</p>
      <p>The remoter corollaries of the change remained to be stated by
      subsequent generations. Luther himself was not consistent. He believed
      that it was possible to maintain the content of medieval social teaching,
      while rejecting its sanctions, and he insisted that good works would be
      the fruit of salvation as vehemently as he denied that they could
      contribute to its attainment. In his writings on social questions emphasis
      on the traditional Christian morality is combined with a repudiation of
      its visible and institutional framework, and in the tragic struggle which
      results between spirit and letter, form and matter, grace and works, his
      intention, at least, is not to jettison the rules of good<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
      conscience in economic matters, but to purify them by an immense effort of
      simplification. His denunciation of medieval charity, fraternities,
      mendicant orders, festivals and pilgrimages, while it drew its point from
      practical abuses, sprang inevitably from his repudiation of the idea that
      merit could be acquired by the operation of some special machinery beyond
      the conscientious discharge of the ordinary duties of daily life. His
      demand for the abolition of the canon law was the natural corollary of his
      belief that the Bible was an all-sufficient guide to action. While not
      rejecting ecclesiastical discipline altogether, he is impatient of it. The
      Christian, he argues, needs no elaborate mechanism to teach him his duty
      or to correct him if he neglects it. He has the Scriptures and his own
      conscience; let him listen to <i>them</i>. “There can be no better
      instructions in ... all transactions in temporal goods than that every man
      who is to deal with his neighbor present to himself these commandments:
      ‘What ye would that others should do unto you, do ye also unto them,’ and
      ‘Love thy neighbor as thyself.’ If these were followed out, then
      everything would instruct and arrange itself; then no law books nor courts
      nor judicial actions would be required; all things would quietly and
      simply be set to rights, for every one’s heart and conscience would guide
      him.”[<a href="#footnote-2-44" id="noteref-2-44">44</a>]</p>
      <p>“Everything would arrange itself.” Few would deny it. But how if it
      does not? Is emotion really an adequate substitute for reason, and
      rhetoric for law? Is it possible to solve the problem which social duties
      present to the individual by informing him that no problem exists? If it
      is true that the inner life is the sphere of religion, does it necessarily
      follow that the external order is simply irrelevant to it? To wave aside
      the world of institutions and law as alien to that of the spirit—is not
      this to abandon, instead of facing, the task of making Christian morality
      prevail, for which medieval writers, with their conception of a
      hierarchy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> of values
      related to a common end, had attempted, however inadequately, to discover
      a formula? A Catholic rationalist had answered by anticipation Luther’s
      contemptuous dismissal of law and learning, when he urged that it was
      useless for the Church to prohibit extortion, unless it was prepared to
      undertake the intellectual labor of defining the transactions to which the
      prohibition applied.[<a href="#footnote-2-45" id="noteref-2-45">45</a>] It
      was a pity that Pecock’s douche of common sense was not of a kind which
      could be appreciated by Luther. He denounced covetousness in general
      terms, with a surprising exuberance of invective. But, confronted with a
      request for advice on the specific question whether the authorities of
      Dantzig shall put down usury, he retreats into the clouds. “The preacher
      shall preach only the Gospel rule, and leave it to each man to follow his
      own conscience. Let him who can receive it, receive it; he cannot be
      compelled thereto further than the Gospel leads willing hearts whom the
      spirit of God urges forward.”[<a href="#footnote-2-46"
      id="noteref-2-46">46</a>]</p>
      <p>Luther’s impotence was not accidental. It sprang directly from his
      fundamental conception that to externalize religion in rules and
      ordinances is to degrade it. He attacked the casuistry of the canonists,
      and the points in their teaching with regard to which his criticism was
      justified were only too numerous. But the remedy for bad law is good law,
      not lawlessness; and casuistry is merely the application of general
      principles to particular cases, which is involved in any living system of
      jurisprudence, whether ecclesiastical or secular. If the principles are
      not to be applied, on the ground that they are too sublime to be soiled by
      contact with the gross world of business and politics, what remains of
      them? Denunciations such as Luther launched against the Fuggers and the
      peasants; aspirations for an idyll of Christian charity and simplicity,
      such as he advanced in his tract <i>On Trade and Usury</i>. Pious
      rhetoric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> may be
      edifying, but it is hardly the panoply recommended by
      <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul.</p>
      <p>“As the soul needs the word alone for life and justification, so it is
      justified by faith alone, and not by any works.... Therefore the first
      care of every Christian ought to be to lay aside all reliance on works,
      and to strengthen his faith alone more and more.”[<a href="#footnote-2-47"
      id="noteref-2-47">47</a>] The logic of Luther’s religious premises was
      more potent for posterity than his attachment to the social ethics of the
      past, and evolved its own inexorable conclusions in spite of them. It
      enormously deepened spiritual experience, and sowed the seeds from which
      new freedoms, abhorrent to Luther, were to spring. But it riveted on the
      social thought of Protestantism a dualism which, as its implications were
      developed, emptied religion of its social content, and society of its
      soul. Between light and darkness a great gulf was fixed. Unable to climb
      upwards plane by plane, man must choose between salvation and damnation.
      If he despairs of attaining the austere heights where alone true faith is
      found, no human institution can avail to help him. Such, Luther thinks,
      will be the fate of only too many.</p>
      <p>He himself was conscious that he had left the world of secular
      activities perilously divorced from spiritual restraints. He met the
      difficulty, partly with an admission that it was insuperable, as one who
      should exult in the majestic unreasonableness of a mysterious Providence,
      whose decrees might not be broken, but could not, save by a few, be
      obeyed; partly with an appeal to the State to occupy the province of
      social ethics, for which his philosophy could find no room in the Church.
      “Here it will be asked, ‘Who then can be saved, and where shall we find
      Christians? For in this fashion no merchandising would remain on
      earth.’... You see it is as I said, that Christians are rare people on
      earth. Therefore stern hard civil rule is necessary in the world, lest the
      world become wild, peace vanish, and<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> commerce and common interests be
      destroyed.... No one need think that the world can be ruled without blood.
      The civil sword shall and must be red and bloody.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-48" id="noteref-2-48">48</a>]</p>
      <p>Thus the axe takes the place of the stake, and authority, expelled from
      the altar, finds a new and securer home upon the throne. The maintenance
      of Christian morality is to be transferred from the discredited
      ecclesiastical authorities to the hands of the State. Skeptical as to the
      existence of unicorns and salamanders, the age of Machiavelli and Henry
      <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> found food for its credulity in the
      worship of that rare monster, the God-fearing Prince.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-2-3"><abbr title="3">III</abbr>. CALVIN</h3>
      <p>The most characteristic and influential form of Protestantism in the
      two centuries following the Reformation is that which descends, by one
      path or another, from the teaching of Calvin. Unlike the Lutheranism from
      which it sprang, Calvinism, assuming different shapes in different
      countries, became an international movement, which brought, not peace, but
      a sword, and the path of which was strewn with revolutions. Where
      Lutheranism had been socially conservative, deferential to established
      political authorities, the exponent of a personal, almost a quietistic,
      piety, Calvinism was an active and radical force. It was a creed which
      sought, not merely to purify the individual, but to reconstruct Church and
      State, and to renew society by penetrating every department of life,
      public as well as private, with the influence of religion.</p>
      <p>Upon the immense political reactions of Calvinism, this is not the
      place to enlarge. As a way of life and a theory of society, it possessed
      from the beginning one characteristic which was both novel and important.
      It assumed an economic organization which was relatively advanced, and
      expounded its social ethics on the basis of it. In this respect<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span> the teaching of the Puritan
      moralists who derive most directly from Calvin is in marked contrast with
      that both of medieval theologians and of Luther. The difference is not
      merely one of the conclusions reached, but of the plane on which the
      discussion is conducted. The background, not only of most medieval social
      theory, but also of Luther and his English contemporaries, is the
      traditional stratification of rural society. It is a natural, rather than
      a money, economy, consisting of the petty dealings of peasants and
      craftsmen in the small market-town, where industry is carried on for the
      subsistence of the household and the consumption of wealth follows hard
      upon the production of it, and where commerce and finance are occasional
      incidents, rather than the forces which keep the whole system in motion.
      When they criticize economic abuses, it is precisely against departures
      from that natural state of things—against the enterprise, the greed of
      gain, the restless competition, which disturb the stability of the
      existing order with clamorous economic appetites—that their criticism is
      directed.</p>
      <p>These ideas were the traditional retort to the evils of unscrupulous
      commercialism, and they left some trace on the writings of the Swiss
      reformers. Zwingli, for example, who, in his outlook on society, stood
      midway between Luther and Calvin, insists on the oft-repeated thesis that
      private property originates in sin; warns the rich that they can hardly
      enter the Kingdom of Heaven; denounces the Councils of Constance and
      Basel—“assembled, forsooth, at the bidding of the Holy Ghost”—for showing
      indulgence to the mortgaging of land on the security of crops; and, while
      emphasizing that interest must be paid when the State sanctions it,
      condemns it in itself as contrary to the law of God.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-49" id="noteref-2-49">49</a>] Of the attempts made at
      Zürich and Geneva to repress extortion something is said below. But these
      full-blooded denunciations of capitalism were not intended by<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> their authors to supply a
      rule of practical life, since it was the duty of the individual to comply
      with the secular legislation by which interest was permitted, and already,
      when they were uttered, they had ceased to represent the conclusion of the
      left wing of the Reformed Churches.</p>
      <p>For Calvin, and still more his later interpreters, began their voyage
      lower down the stream. Unlike Luther, who saw economic life with the eyes
      of a peasant and a mystic, they approached it as men of affairs, disposed
      neither to idealize the patriarchal virtues of the peasant community, nor
      to regard with suspicion the mere fact of capitalist enterprise in
      commerce and finance. Like early Christianity and modern socialism,
      Calvinism was largely an urban movement; like them, in its earlier days,
      it was carried from country to country partly by emigrant traders and
      workmen; and its stronghold was precisely in those social groups to which
      the traditional scheme of social ethics, with its treatment of economic
      interests as a quite minor aspect of human affairs, must have seemed
      irrelevant or artificial. As was to be expected in the exponents of a
      faith which had its headquarters at Geneva, and later its most influential
      adherents in great business centers, like Antwerp with its industrial
      hinterland, London, and Amsterdam, its leaders addressed their teaching,
      not of course exclusively, but none the less primarily, to the classes
      engaged in trade and industry, who formed the most modern and progressive
      elements in the life of the age.</p>
      <p>In doing so they naturally started from a frank recognition of the
      necessity of capital, credit and banking, large-scale commerce and
      finance, and the other practical facts of business life. They thus broke
      with the tradition which, regarding a preoccupation with economic
      interests “beyond what is necessary for subsistence” as reprehensible, had
      stigmatized the middleman as a parasite and the usurer as a thief. They
      set the profits of trade and finance, which to<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> the medieval writer, as to Luther, only with
      difficulty escaped censure as <i lang="la">turpe lucrum</i>, on the same
      level of respectability as the earnings of the laborer and the rents of
      the landlord. “What reason is there,” wrote Calvin to a correspondent,
      “why the income from business should not be larger than that from
      land-owning? Whence do the merchant’s profits come, except from his own
      diligence and industry?”[<a href="#footnote-2-50"
      id="noteref-2-50">50</a>] It was quite in accordance with the spirit of
      those words that Bucer, even while denouncing the frauds and avarice of
      merchants, should urge the English Government to undertake the development
      of the woollen industry on mercantilist lines.[<a href="#footnote-2-51"
      id="noteref-2-51">51</a>]</p>
      <p>Since it is the environment of the industrial and commercial classes
      which is foremost in the thoughts of Calvin and his followers, they have
      to make terms with its practical necessities. It is not that they abandon
      the claim of religion to moralize economic life, but that the life which
      they are concerned to moralize is one in which the main features of a
      commercial civilization are taken for granted, and that it is for
      application to such conditions that their teaching is designed. Early
      Calvinism, as we shall see, has its own rule, and a rigorous rule, for the
      conduct of economic affairs. But it no longer suspects the whole world of
      economic motives as alien to the life of the spirit, or distrusts the
      capitalist as one who has necessarily grown rich on the misfortunes of his
      neighbor, or regards poverty as in itself meritorious, and it is perhaps
      the first systematic body of religious teaching which can be said to
      recognize and applaud the economic virtues. Its enemy is not the
      accumulation of riches, but their misuse for purposes of self-indulgence
      or ostentation. Its ideal is a society which seeks wealth with the sober
      gravity of men who are conscious at once of disciplining their own
      characters by patient labor, and of devoting themselves to a service
      acceptable to God.</p>
      <p>It is in the light of that change of social perspective that<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> the doctrine of usury
      associated with the name of Calvin is to be interpreted. Its significance
      consisted, not in the phase which it marked in the technique of economic
      analysis, but in its admission to a new position of respectability of a
      powerful and growing body of social interests, which, however
      irrepressible in practice, had hitherto been regarded by religious theory
      as, at best, of dubious propriety, and, at worst, as frankly immoral.
      Strictly construed, the famous pronouncement strikes the modern reader
      rather by its rigor than by its indulgence. “Calvin,” wrote an English
      divine a generation after his death, “deals with usurie as the apothecarie
      doth with poyson.”[<a href="#footnote-2-52" id="noteref-2-52">52</a>] The
      apologetic was just, for neither his letter to Œcolampadius, nor his
      sermon on the same subject, reveal any excessive tolerance for the trade
      of the financier. That interest is lawful, provided that it does not
      exceed an official maximum, that, even when a maximum is fixed, loans must
      be made <i lang="fr">gratis</i> to the poor, that the borrower must reap
      as much advantage as the lender, that excessive security must not be
      exacted, that what is venial as an occasional expedient is reprehensible
      when carried on as a regular occupation, that no man may snatch economic
      gain for himself to the injury of his neighbor—a condonation of usury
      protected by such embarrassing entanglements can have offered but tepid
      consolation to the devout money-lender.</p>
      <p>Contemporaries interpreted Calvin to mean that the debtor might
      properly be asked to concede some small part of his profits to the
      creditor with whose capital they had been earned, but that the exaction of
      interest was wrong if it meant that “the creditor becomes rich by the
      sweat of the debtor, and the debtor does not reap the reward of his
      labor.” There have been ages in which such doctrines would have been
      regarded as an attack on financial enterprise rather than as a defense of
      it. Nor were Calvin’s specific contributions to the theory of usury
      strikingly original. As a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg
      107]</span> hard-headed lawyer, he was free both from the incoherence and
      from the idealism of Luther, and his doctrine was probably regarded by
      himself merely as one additional step in the long series of developments
      through which ecclesiastical jurisprudence on the subject had already
      gone. In emphasizing the difference between the interest wrung from the
      necessities of the poor and the interest which a prosperous merchant could
      earn with borrowed capital, he had been anticipated by Major; in his
      sanction of a moderate rate on loans to the rich, his position was the
      same as that already assumed, though with some hesitation, by Melanchthon.
      The picture of Calvin, the organizer and disciplinarian, as the parent of
      laxity in social ethics, is a legend. Like the author of another
      revolution in economic theory, he might have turned on his popularizers
      with the protest: “I am not a Calvinist.”</p>
      <p>Legends are apt, however, to be as right in substance as they are wrong
      in detail, and both its critics and its defenders were correct in
      regarding Calvin’s treatment of capital as a watershed. What he did was to
      change the plane on which the discussion was conducted, by treating the
      ethics of money-lending, not as a matter to be decided by an appeal to a
      special body of doctrine on the subject of usury, but as a particular case
      of the general problem of the social relations of a Christian community,
      which must be solved in the light of existing circumstances. The
      significant feature in his discussion of the subject is that he assumes
      credit to be a normal and inevitable incident in the life of society. He
      therefore dismisses the oft-quoted passages from the Old Testament and the
      Fathers as irrelevant, because designed for conditions which no longer
      exist, argues that the payment of interest for capital is as reasonable as
      the payment of rent for land, and throws on the conscience of the
      individual the obligation of seeing that it does not exceed the amount

      justice and the golden rule. He makes, in short, a fresh start, argues
      that what is permanent is, not the rule “<i lang="fr">non fœnerabis</i>,”
      <i>but</i> “<i lang="fr">l’équité et la droiture</i>,” and appeals from
      Christian tradition to commercial common sense, which he is sanguine
      enough to hope will be Christian. On such a view all extortion is to be
      avoided by Christians. But capital and credit are indispensable; the
      financier is not a pariah, but a useful member of society; and lending at
      interest, provided that the rate is reasonable and that loans are made
      freely to the poor, is not <i lang="la">per se</i> more extortionate than
      any other of the economic transactions without which human affairs cannot
      be carried on. That acceptance of the realities of commercial practice as
      a starting-point was of momentous importance. It meant that Calvinism and
      its off-shoots took their stand on the side of the activities which were
      to be most characteristic of the future, and insisted that it was not by
      renouncing them, but by untiring concentration on the task of using for
      the glory of God the opportunities which they offered, that the Christian
      life could and must be lived.</p>
      <p>It was on this practical basis of urban industry and commercial
      enterprise that the structure of Calvinistic social ethics was erected.
      Upon their theological background it would be audacious to enter. But even
      an amateur may be pardoned, if he feels that there have been few systems
      in which the practical conclusions flow by so inevitable a logic from the
      theological premises. “God not only foresaw,” Calvin wrote, “the fall of
      the first man, ... but also arranged all by the determination of his own
      will.”[<a href="#footnote-2-53" id="noteref-2-53">53</a>] Certain
      individuals he chose as his elect, predestined to salvation from eternity
      by “his gratuitous mercy, totally irrespective of human merit”; the
      remainder have been consigned to eternal damnation, “by a just and
      irreprehensible, but incomprehensible, judgment.”[<a href="#footnote-2-54"
      id="noteref-2-54">54</a>] Deliverance, in short, is the work, not of man
      himself, who can contribute nothing to it,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> but of an objective Power. Human effort,
      social institutions, the world of culture, are at best irrelevant to
      salvation, and at worst mischievous. They distract man from the true aim
      of his existence and encourage reliance upon broken reeds.</p>
      <p>That aim is not personal salvation, but the glorification of God, to be
      sought, not by prayer only, but by action—the sanctification of the world
      by strife and labor. For Calvinism, with all its repudiation of personal
      merit, is intensely practical. Good works are not a way of attaining
      salvation, but they are indispensable as a proof that salvation has been
      attained. The central paradox of religious ethics—that only those are
      nerved with the courage needed to turn the world upside down, who are
      convinced that already, in a higher sense, it is disposed for the best by
      a Power of which they are the humble instruments—finds in it a special
      exemplification. For the Calvinist the world is ordained to show forth the
      majesty of God, and the duty of the Christian is to live for that end. His
      task is at once to discipline his individual life, and to create a
      sanctified society. The Church, the State, the community in which he
      lives, must not merely be a means of personal salvation, or minister to
      his temporal needs. It must be a “Kingdom of Christ,” in which individual
      duties are performed by men conscious that they are “ever in their great
      Taskmaster’s eye,” and the whole fabric is preserved from corruption by a
      stringent and all-embracing discipline.</p>
      <p>The impetus to reform or revolution springs in every age from the
      realization of the contrast between the external order of society and the
      moral standards recognized as valid by the conscience or reason of the
      individual. And naturally it is in periods of swift material progress,
      such as the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, that such a contrast is
      most acutely felt. The men who made the Reformation had seen the Middle
      Ages close in the golden autumn which,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> amid all the corruption and tyranny of the
      time, still glows in the pictures of Nürnberg and Frankfurt drawn by Æneas
      Silvius and in the woodcuts of Dürer. And already a new dawn of economic
      prosperity was unfolding. Its promise was splendid, but it had been
      accompanied by a cynical materialism which seemed a denial of all that had
      been meant by the Christian virtues, and which was the more horrifying
      because it was in the capital of the Christian Church that it reached its
      height. Shocked by the gulf between theory and practice, men turned this
      way and that to find some solution of the tension which racked them. The
      German reformers followed one road and preached a return to primitive
      simplicity. But who could obliterate the achievements of two centuries, or
      blot out the new worlds which science had revealed? The Humanists took
      another, which should lead to the gradual regeneration of mankind by the
      victory of reason over superstition and brutality and avarice. But who
      could wait for so distant a consummation? Might there not be a third? Was
      it not possible that, purified and disciplined, the very qualities which
      economic success demanded—thrift, diligence, sobriety, frugality—were
      themselves, after all, the foundation, at least, of the Christian virtues?
      Was it not conceivable that the gulf which yawned between a luxurious
      world and the life of the spirit could be bridged, not by eschewing
      material interests as the kingdom of darkness, but by dedicating them to
      the service of God?</p>
      <p>It was that revolution in the traditional scale of ethical values which
      the Swiss reformers desired to achieve; it was that new type of Christian
      character that they labored to create. Not as part of any scheme of social
      reform, but as elements in a plan of moral regeneration, they seized on
      the aptitudes cultivated by the life of business and affairs, stamped on
      them a new sanctification, and used them as the warp of a society in which
      a more than Roman discipline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg
      111]</span> should perpetuate a character the exact antithesis of that
      fostered by obedience to Rome. The Roman Church, it was held, through the
      example of its rulers, had encouraged luxury and ostentation: the members
      of the Reformed Church must be economical and modest. It had sanctioned
      the spurious charity of indiscriminate almsgiving: the true Christian must
      repress mendicancy and insist on the virtues of industry and thrift. It
      had allowed the faithful to believe that they could atone for a life of
      worldliness by the savorless formality of individual good works reduced to
      a commercial system, as though man could keep a profit and loss account
      with his Creator: the true Christian must organize his life as a whole for
      the service of his Master. It had rebuked the pursuit of gain as lower
      than the life of religion, even while it took bribes from those who
      pursued gain with success: the Christian must conduct his business with a
      high seriousness, as in itself a kind of religion.</p>
      <p>Such teaching, whatever its theological merits or defects, was
      admirably designed to liberate economic energies, and to weld into a
      disciplined social force the rising <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>,
      conscious of the contrast between its own standards and those of a laxer
      world, proud of its vocation as the standard-bearer of the economic
      virtues, and determined to vindicate an open road for its own way of life
      by the use of every weapon, including political revolution and war,
      because the issue which was at stake was not merely convenience or
      self-interest, but the will of God. Calvinism stood, in short, not only
      for a new doctrine of theology and ecclesiastical government, but for a
      new scale of moral values and a new ideal of social conduct. Its practical
      message, it might perhaps be said, was <i lang="fr">la carrière
      ouverte</i>—not <i lang="fr">aux talents</i>, but <i lang="fr">au
      caractère</i>.</p>
      <p>Once the world had been settled to their liking, the middle classes
      persuaded themselves that they were the convinced enemies of violence and
      the devotees of the principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg
      112]</span> of order. While their victories were still to win, they were
      everywhere the spear-head of revolution. It is not wholly fanciful to say
      that, on a narrower stage but with not less formidable weapons, Calvin did
      for the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> of the sixteenth century what Marx
      did for the proletariat of the nineteenth, or that the doctrine of
      predestination satisfied the same hunger for an assurance that the forces
      of the universe are on the side of the elect as was to be assuaged in a
      different age by the theory of historical materialism. He set their
      virtues at their best in sharp antithesis with the vices of the
      established order at its worst, taught them to feel that they were a
      chosen people, made them conscious of their great destiny in the
      Providential plan and resolute to realize it. The new law was graven on
      tablets of flesh; it not merely rehearsed a lesson, but fashioned a soul.
      Compared with the quarrelsome, self-indulgent nobility of most European
      countries, or with the extravagant and half-bankrupt monarchies, the
      middle classes in whom Calvinism took root most deeply, were a race of
      iron. It was not surprising that they made several revolutions, and
      imprinted their conceptions of political and social expediency on the
      public life of half a dozen different States in the Old World and in the
      New.</p>
      <p>The two main elements in this teaching were the insistence on personal
      responsibility, discipline and asceticism, and the call to fashion for the
      Christian character an objective embodiment in social institutions. Though
      logically connected, they were often in practical discord. The influence
      of Calvinism was not simple, but complex, and extended far beyond the
      circle of Churches which could properly be called Calvinist. Calvinist
      theology was accepted where Calvinist discipline was repudiated. The
      bitter struggle between Presbyterians and Independents in England did not
      prevent men, to whom the whole idea of religious uniformity was
      fundamentally abhorrent, from drawing inspiration from<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> the conception of a visible
      Christian society, in which, as one of them said, the Scripture was
      “really and materially to be fulfilled.”[<a href="#footnote-2-55"
      id="noteref-2-55">55</a>] Both an intense individualism and a rigorous
      Christian Socialism could be deduced from Calvin’s doctrine. Which of them
      predominated depended on differences of political environment and of
      social class. It depended, above all, on the question whether Calvinists
      were, as at Geneva and in Scotland, a majority, who could stamp their
      ideals on the social order, or, as in England, a minority, living on the
      defensive beneath the suspicious eyes of a hostile Government.</p>
      <p>In the version of Calvinism which found favor with the English upper
      classes in the seventeenth century, individualism in social affairs was,
      on the whole, the prevalent philosophy. It was only the fanatic and the
      agitator who drew inspiration from the vision of a New Jerusalem
      descending on England’s green and pleasant land, and the troopers of
      Fairfax soon taught them reason. But, if the theology of Puritanism was
      that of Calvin, its conception of society, diluted by the practical
      necessities of a commercial age, and softened to suit the conventions of a
      territorial aristocracy, was poles apart from that of the master who
      founded a discipline, compared with which that of Laud, as Laud himself
      dryly observed,[<a href="#footnote-2-56" id="noteref-2-56">56</a>] was a
      thing of shreds and patches. As both the teaching of Calvin himself, and
      the practice of some Calvinist communities, suggest, the social ethics of
      the heroic age of Calvinism savored more of a collectivist dictatorship
      than of individualism. The expression of a revolt against the medieval
      ecclesiastical system, it stood itself, where circumstances favored it,
      for a discipline far more stringent and comprehensive than that of the
      Middle Ages. If, as some historians have argued, the philosophy of <i
      lang="fr">laissez faire</i> emerged as a result of the spread of Calvinism
      among the middle classes, it did so, like tolerance, by a route which was
      indirect. It was accepted, less because it was<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> esteemed for its own sake, than as a
      compromise forced upon Calvinism at a comparatively late stage in its
      history, as a result of its modification by the pressure of commercial
      interests, or of a balance of power between conflicting authorities.</p>
      <p>The spirit of the system is suggested by its treatment of the burning
      question of Pauperism. The reform of traditional methods of poor relief
      was in the air—Vives had written his celebrated book in 1526[<a
      href="#footnote-2-57" id="noteref-2-57">57</a>]—and, prompted both by
      Humanists and by men of religion, the secular authorities all over Europe
      were beginning to bestir themselves to cope with what was, at best, a
      menace to social order, and, at worst, a moral scandal. The question was
      naturally one which appealed strongly to the ethical spirit of the
      Reformation. The characteristic of the Swiss reformers, who were much
      concerned with it, was that they saw the situation not, like the
      statesman, as a problem of police, nor, like the more intelligent
      Humanists, as a problem of social organization, but as a question of
      character. Calvin quoted with approval the words of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, “If a man will not work, neither shall he
      eat,” condemned indiscriminate almsgiving as vehemently as any
      Utilitarian, and urged that the ecclesiastical authorities should
      regularly visit every family to ascertain whether its members were idle,
      or drunken, or otherwise undesirable.[<a href="#footnote-2-58"
      id="noteref-2-58">58</a>] Œcolampadius wrote two tracts on the relief of
      the poor.[<a href="#footnote-2-59" id="noteref-2-59">59</a>] Bullinger
      lamented the army of beggars produced by monastic charity, and secured
      part of the emoluments of a dissolved abbey for the maintenance of a
      school and the assistance of the destitute.[<a href="#footnote-2-60"
      id="noteref-2-60">60</a>] In the plan for the reorganization of poor
      relief at Zürich, which was drafted by Zwingli in 1525, all mendicancy was
      strictly forbidden; travellers were to be relieved on condition that they
      left the town next day; provision was to be made for the sick and aged in
      special institutions; no inhabitant was to be entitled to relief who wore
      ornaments or luxurious clothes, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg
      115]</span> failed to attend church, or who played cards or was otherwise
      disreputable. The basis of his whole scheme was the duty of industry and
      the danger of relaxing the incentive to work. “With labor,” he wrote,
      “will no man now support himself.... And yet labor is a thing so good and
      godlike ... that makes the body hale and strong and cures the sicknesses
      produced by idleness.... In the things of this life, the laborer is most
      like to God.”[<a href="#footnote-2-61" id="noteref-2-61">61</a>]</p>
      <p>In the assault on pauperism, moral and economic motives were not
      distinguished. The idleness of the mendicant was both a sin against God
      and a social evil; the enterprise of the thriving tradesman was at once a
      Christian virtue and a benefit to the community. The same combination of
      religious zeal and practical shrewdness prompted the attacks on gambling,
      swearing, excess in apparel and self-indulgence in eating and drinking.
      The essence of the system was not preaching or propaganda, though it was
      prolific of both, but the attempt to crystallize a moral ideal in the
      daily life of a visible society, which should be at once a Church and a
      State. Having overthrown monasticism, its aim was to turn the secular
      world into a gigantic monastery, and at Geneva, for a short time, it
      almost succeeded. “In other places,” wrote Knox of that devoted city, “I
      confess Christ to be truly preached, but manners and religion so sincerely
      reformed I have not yet seen in any place besides.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-62" id="noteref-2-62">62</a>] Manners and morals were
      regulated, because it is through the <i lang="la">minutiæ</i> of conduct
      that the enemy of mankind finds his way to the soul; the traitors to the
      Kingdom might be revealed by pointed shoes or golden ear-rings, as in 1793
      those guilty of another kind of <i lang="fr">incivisme</i> were betrayed
      by their knee-breeches. Regulation meant legislation, and, still more,
      administration. The word in which both were summarized was Discipline.</p>
      <p>Discipline Calvin himself described as the nerves of religion,[<a
      href="#footnote-2-63" id="noteref-2-63">63</a>] and the common observation
      that he assigned to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
      the same primacy as Luther had given to faith is just. As organized in the
      Calvinist Churches, it was designed primarily to safeguard the sacrament
      and to enforce a censorship of morals, and thus differed in scope and
      purpose from the canon law of the Church of Rome, as the rules of a
      private society may differ from the code of a State. Its establishment at
      Geneva, in the form which it assumed in the last half of the sixteenth
      century, was the result of nearly twenty years of struggle between the
      Council of the city and the Consistory, composed of ministers and laymen.
      It was only in 1555 that the latter finally vindicated its right to
      excommunicate, and only in the edition of the <i>Institutes</i> which
      appeared in 1559 that a scheme of church organization and discipline was
      set out. But, while the answer to the question of the constitution of the
      authority by whom discipline was to be exercised depended on political
      conditions, and thus differed in different places and periods, the
      necessity of enforcing a rule of life, which was the practical aspect of
      discipline, was from the start of the very essence of Calvinism. Its
      importance was the theme of a characteristic letter addressed by Calvin to
      Somerset in October 1548, the moment of social convulsion for which Bucer
      wrote his book, <i lang="la">De Regno Christi</i>. The Protector is
      reminded that it is not from lack of preaching, but from failure to
      enforce compliance with it, that the troubles of England have sprung.
      Though crimes of violence are punished, the licentious are spared, and the
      licentious have no part in the Kingdom of God. He is urged to make sure
      that “les hommes soient tenus en bonne et honneste discipline,” and to be
      careful “que ceulx qui oyent la doctrine de l’Evangile s’approuvent estre
      Chrestiens par sainctité de vie.”[<a href="#footnote-2-64"
      id="noteref-2-64">64</a>]</p>
      <p>“Prove themselves Christians by holiness of life”—the words might be
      taken as the motto of the Swiss reformers, and their projects of social
      reconstruction are a commentary on the sense in which “holiness of life”
      was understood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span> It was
      in that spirit that Zwingli took the initiative in forming at Zürich a
      board of moral discipline, to be composed of the clergy, the magistrates
      and two elders; emphasized the importance of excommunicating offenders
      against Christian morals; and drew up a list of sins to be punished by
      excommunication, which included, in addition to murder and theft,
      unchastity, perjury and avarice, “especially as it discovers itself in
      usury and fraud.”[<a href="#footnote-2-65" id="noteref-2-65">65</a>] It
      was in that spirit that Calvin composed in the
      <i>Institutes</i> a Protestant <i lang="la">Summa</i> and manual of moral
      casuistry, in which the lightest action should be brought under the iron
      control of a universal rule. It was in that spirit that he drafted the
      heads of a comprehensive scheme of municipal government, covering the
      whole range of civic administration, from the regulations to be made for
      markets, crafts, buildings and fairs to the control of prices, interest
      and rents.[<a href="#footnote-2-66" id="noteref-2-66">66</a>] It was in
      that spirit that he made Geneva a city of glass, in which every household
      lived its life under the supervision of a spiritual police, and that for a
      generation Consistory and Council worked hand in hand, the former
      excommunicating drunkards, dancers and contemners of religion, the latter
      punishing the dissolute with fines and imprisonment and the heretic with
      death. “Having considered,” ran the preamble to the ordinances of 1576,
      which mark the maturity of the Genevese Church, “that it is a thing worthy
      of commendation above all others, that the doctrine of the Holy Gospel of
      our Lord Jesus Christ shall be preserved in its purity, and the Christian
      Church duly maintained by good government and policy, and also that youth
      in the future be well and faithfully instructed, and the Hospital
      well-ordered for the support of the poor: Which things can only be if
      there be established a certain rule and order of living, by which each man
      may be able to understand the duties of his position....”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-67" id="noteref-2-67">67</a>] The object of it all was
      so simple. “Each man to understand the duties of his position”—what could
      be more desirable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> at
      Geneva or elsewhere? It is sad to reflect that the attainment of so
      laudable an end involved the systematic use of torture, the beheading of a
      child for striking its parents, and the burning of a hundred and fifty
      heretics in sixty years.[<a href="#footnote-2-68"
      id="noteref-2-68">68</a>] <i lang="la">Tantum religio potuit suadere
      malorum.</i></p>
      <p>Torturing and burning were practised elsewhere by Governments which
      affected no excessive zeal for righteousness. The characteristic which was
      distinctive of Geneva—“the most perfect school of Christ that ever was on
      earth since the days of the Apostles”[<a href="#footnote-2-69"
      id="noteref-2-69">69</a>]—was not its merciless intolerance, for no one
      yet dreamed that tolerance was possible. It was the attempt to make the
      law of God prevail even in those matters of pecuniary gain and loss which
      mankind, to judge by its history, is disposed to regard more seriously
      than wounds and deaths. “No member [of the Christian body],” wrote Calvin
      in his <i>Institutes</i>, “holds his gifts to himself, or for his private
      use, but shares them among his fellow members, nor does he derive benefit
      save from those things which proceed from the common profit of the body as
      a whole. Thus the pious man owes to his brethren all that it is in his
      power to give.”[<a href="#footnote-2-70" id="noteref-2-70">70</a>] It was
      natural that so remorseless an attempt to claim the totality of human
      interests for religion should not hesitate to engage even the economic
      appetites, before which the Churches of a later generation were to lower
      their arms. If Calvinism welcomed the world of business to its fold with
      an eagerness unknown before, it did so in the spirit of a conqueror
      organizing a new province, not of a suppliant arranging a compromise with
      a still powerful foe. A system of morals and a code of law lay ready to
      its hand in the Old Testament. Samuel and Agag, King of the Amalekites,
      Jonah and Nineveh, Ahab and Naboth, Elijah and the prophets of Baal,
      Micaiah the son of Imlah, the only true prophet of the Lord, and Jeroboam
      the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, worked on the tense imagination
      of the Calvinist as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span> did
      Brutus and Cassius on the men of 1793. The first half-century of the
      Reformed Church at Geneva saw a prolonged effort to organize an economic
      order worthy of the Kingdom of Christ, in which the ministers played the
      part of Old Testament prophets to an Israel not wholly weaned from the

      <p>Apart from its qualified indulgence to interest, Calvinism made few
      innovations in the details of social policy, and the contents of the
      program were thoroughly medieval. The novelty consisted in the religious
      zeal which was thrown into its application. The organ of administration
      before which offenders were brought was the Consistory, a mixed body of
      laymen and ministers. It censures harsh creditors, punishes usurers,
      engrossers and monopolists, reprimands or fines the merchant who defrauds
      his clients, the cloth-maker whose stuff is an inch too narrow, the dealer
      who provides short measure of coal, the butcher who sells meat above the
      rates fixed by authority, the tailor who charges strangers excessive
      prices, the surgeon who demands an excessive fee for an operation.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-71" id="noteref-2-71">71</a>] In the Consistory the
      ministers appear to have carried all before them, and they are constantly
      pressing for greater stringency. From the election of Beza in place of
      Calvin in 1564 to his death in 1605, hardly a year passes without a new
      demand for legislation from the clergy, a new censure on economic
      unrighteousness, a new protest against one form or another of the ancient
      sin of avarice. At one moment, it is excessive indulgence to debtors which
      rouses their indignation; at another, the advance of prices and rents
      caused by the influx of distressed brethren from the persecutions in
      France; at a third, the multiplication of taverns and the excessive
      charges demanded by the sellers of wine. Throughout there is a prolonged
      warfare against the twin evils of extortionate interest and extortionate
      prices.</p>
      <p>Credit was an issue of moment at Geneva, not merely<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
      for the same reasons which made it a burning question everywhere to the
      small producer of the sixteenth century, but because, especially after the
      ruin of Lyons in the French wars of religion, the city was a financial
      center of some importance. It might be involved in war at any moment. In
      order to secure command of the necessary funds, it had borrowed heavily
      from Basle and Berne, and the Council used the capital to do exchange
      business and make advances, the rate of interest being fixed at 10, and
      later at 12, per cent. To the establishment of a bank the ministers, who
      had been consulted, agreed; against the profitable business of advancing
      money at high rates of interest to private persons they protested,
      especially when the loans were made to spendthrifts who used them to ruin
      themselves. When, ten years later, in 1580, the Council approved the
      project advanced by some company promoters of establishing a second bank
      in the city, the ministers led the opposition to it, pointed to the danger
      of covetousness as revealed by the moral corruption of financial cities
      such as Paris, Venice and Lyons, and succeeded in getting the proposal
      quashed. Naturally, however, the commoner issue was a more simple one. The
      capitalist who borrowed in order to invest and make a profit could take
      care of himself, and the ministers explained that they had no objection to
      those “qui baillent leur argent aux marchands pour emploier en
      marchandise.” The crucial issue was that of the money-lender who makes
      advances “simplement à un qui aura besoin,” and who thereby exploits the
      necessities of his poorer neighbors.[<a href="#footnote-2-72"
      id="noteref-2-72">72</a>]</p>
      <p>Against monsters of this kind the ministers rage without ceasing. They
      denounce them from the pulpit in the name of the New Testament, in
      language drawn principally from the less temperate portions of the Old, as
      <i lang="fr">larrons, brigands, loups et tigres</i>, who ought to be led
      out of the city and stoned to death. “The poor cry and the rich pocket
      their gains; but what they are heaping up for themselves is the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> wrath of God.... One has
      cried in the market-place, ‘a curse on those who bring us dearth.’... The
      Lord has heard that cry ... and yet we are asking the cause of the
      pestilence!... A cut-purse shall be punished, but the Lord declares by his
      prophet Amos ... ‘Famine is come upon my people of Israel, O ye who devour
      the poor.’ The threats there uttered have been executed against his
      people.”[<a href="#footnote-2-73" id="noteref-2-73">73</a>] They demand
      that for his second offense the usurer shall be excommunicated, or that,
      if such a punishment be thought too severe, he shall at least be required
      to testify his repentance publicly in church, before being admitted to the
      sacrament. They remind their fellow-citizens of the fate of Tyre and
      Sidon, and, momentarily despairing of controlling the money-lender
      directly, they propose to deprive him of his victims by removing the
      causes which create them.
      <i lang="fr">Pour tarir les ruisseaux il faut escouper la source.</i> Men
      borrow because of “idleness, foolish extravagance, foolish sins, and law
      suits.” Let censors be established at Geneva, as in Republican Rome, to
      inquire, among rich as well as among poor, how each household earns its
      livelihood, to see that all children of ten to twelve are taught some
      useful trade, to put down taverns and litigation, and to “bridle the
      insatiable avarice of those who are such wretches that they seek to enrich
      themselves by the necessities of their poor neighbors.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-74" id="noteref-2-74">74</a>]</p>
      <p>The Venerable Company advanced their program, but they were not
      sanguine that it would be carried out, and they concluded it by expressing
      to the City Fathers the pious hope, not wholly free from irony, that “none
      of your honorable fellowship may be found spotted with such vices.” Their
      apprehensions were justified. The Council of Geneva endured many things at
      the hands of its preachers, till, on the death of Beza, it brought them to
      heel. But there were limits to its patience, and it was in the field of
      business ethics that they were most quickly reached. It did not
      venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> to question the
      right of the clergy to be heard on matters of commerce and finance. The
      pulpit was press and platform in one; ministers had the public behind
      them, and, conscious of their power, would in the last resort compel
      submission by threatening to resign <i lang="fr">en masse</i>. Profuse in
      expressions of sympathy, its strategy was to let the cannon balls of
      Christian Socialism spend themselves on the yielding down of official
      procrastination, and its first reply was normally <i lang="fr">qu’on y
      pense un peu</i>. To the clergy its inactivity was a new proof of
      complicity with Mammon, and they did not hesitate to declare their
      indignation from the pulpit. In 1574 Beza preached a sermon in which he
      accused members of the Council of having intelligence with speculators who
      had made a corner in wheat. Throughout 1577 the ministers were reproaching
      the Council with laxity in administration, and they finally denounced it
      as the real author of the rise in the prices of bread and wine. In 1579
      they addressed to it a memorandum, setting out a new scheme of moral
      discipline and social reform.</p>
      <p>The prosperous <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> who governed Geneva had no
      objection to discouraging extravagance in dress, or to exhorting the
      public to attend sermons and to send their children to catechism. But they
      heard denunciations of covetousness without enthusiasm, and on two matters
      they were obdurate. They refused to check, as the ministers concerned to
      lower prices had demanded, the export of wine, on the ground that it was
      needed in order to purchase imports of wheat; and, as was natural in a
      body of well-to-do creditors, they would make no concession to the
      complaint that debtors were subjected to a “double usury,” since they were
      compelled to repay loans in an appreciating currency. Money fell as well
      as rose, they replied, and even the late M. Calvin, by whom the ordinance
      now criticized had been approved, had never pushed his scruples to such
      lengths. Naturally, the ministers were indignant at these evasions.<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span> They informed the Council
      that large sums were being spent by speculators in holding up supplies of
      corn, and launched a campaign of sermons against avarice, with appropriate
      topical illustrations. Equally naturally, the Council retorted by accusing
      Beza of stirring up class hatred against the rich.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-75" id="noteref-2-75">75</a>]</p>
      <p>The situation was aggravated by an individual scandal. One of the
      magistrates, who regarded Beza’s remarks as a personal reflection, was
      rash enough to demand to be heard before the Council, with the result that
      he was found guilty, condemned to pay a fine, and compelled to forfeit
      fifty crowns which he had lent at 10 per cent. interest. Evidently, when
      matters were pushed to such lengths as this, no one, however respectable,
      could feel sure that he was safe. The Council and the ministers had
      already had words over the sphere of their respective functions, and were
      to fall out a year or two later over the administration of the local
      hospital. On this occasion the Council complained that the clergy were
      interfering with the magistrates’ duties, and implied politely that they
      would be well advised to mind their own business.</p>
      <p>So monstrous a suggestion—as though there were any human activity which
      was not the business of the Church!—evoked a counter-manifesto on the part
      of the ministers, in which the full doctrine of the earthly Jerusalem was
      set forth in all its majesty. They declined to express regret for having
      cited before the Consistory those who sold corn at extortionate prices,
      and for refusing the sacrament to one of them. Did not Solomon say,
      “Cursed is he who keeps his corn in time of scarcity”? To the charge of
      intemperate language Chauvet replied that the Council had better begin by
      burning the books of the Prophets, for he had done no more than follow the
      example set by Hosea. “If we should be silent,” said Beza, “what would the
      people say? That they are dumb dogs.... As to the question of causing<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> scandals, for the last two
      years there has been unceasing talk of usury, and, for all that, no more
      than three or four usurers have been punished.... It is notorious
      everywhere that the city is full of usurers, and that the ordinary rate is
      10 per cent. or more.”[<a href="#footnote-2-76" id="noteref-2-76">76</a>]
      The magistrates renewed their remonstrances. They had seen without a
      shudder an adulterer condemned to be hanged, and had mercifully commuted
      his sentence to scourging through the town, followed by ten years’
      imprisonment in chains.[<a href="#footnote-2-77" id="noteref-2-77">77</a>]
      But at the godly proposal to make capitalists die the death of Achan their
      humanity blenched. Besides, the punishment was not only cruel, but
      dangerous. In Geneva, “most men are debtors.” If they are allowed to taste
      blood, who can say where their fury will end? Yet, such is the power of
      the spoken word, the magistrates did not venture on a blunt refusal, but
      gave scripture for scripture. They informed the ministers that they
      proposed to follow the example of David, who, when rebuked by Nathan,
      confessed his fault. Whether the ministers replied in the language of
      Nathan, we are not informed.</p>
      <p>Recent political theory has been prolific in criticisms of the
      omnicompetent State. The principle on which the collectivism of Geneva
      rested may be described as that of the omnicompetent Church.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-78" id="noteref-2-78">78</a>] The religious community
      formed a closely organized society, which, while using the secular
      authorities as police officers to enforce its mandates, not only
      instructed them as to the policy to be pursued, but was itself a kind of
      State, prescribing by its own legislation the standard of conduct to be
      observed by its members, putting down offences against public order and
      public morals, providing for the education of youth and for the relief of
      the poor. The peculiar relations between the ecclesiastical and secular
      authorities, which for a short time made the system possible at Geneva,
      could not exist to the same degree when Calvinism was the creed, not of a
      single city, but of a minority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg
      125]</span> in a national State organized on principles quite different
      from its own. Unless the State itself were captured, rebellion, civil war
      or the abandonment of the pretension to control society was the inevitable
      consequence. But the last result was long delayed. In the sixteenth
      century, whatever the political conditions, the claim of the Calvinist
      Churches is everywhere to exercise a collective responsibility for the
      moral conduct of their members in all the various relations of life, and
      to do so, not least, in the sphere of economic transactions, which offer
      peculiarly insidious temptations to a lapse into immorality.</p>
      <p>The mantle of Calvin’s system fell earliest upon the Reformed Churches
      of France. At their first Synod, held in 1559 at Paris, where a scheme of
      discipline was adopted, certain difficult matters of economic casuistry
      were discussed, and similar questions continued to receive attention at
      subsequent Synods for the next half-century, until, as the historian of
      French Calvinism remarks, “they began to lax the reins, yielding too much
      to the iniquity of the time.”[<a href="#footnote-2-79"
      id="noteref-2-79">79</a>] Once it is admitted that membership of the
      Church involves compliance with a standard of economic morality which the
      Church must enforce, the problems of interpretation which arise are
      innumerable, and the religious community finds itself committed to
      developing something like a system of case law, by the application of its
      general principles to a succession of varying situations. The elaboration
      of such a system was undertaken; but it was limited in the sixteenth
      century both by the comparative simplicity of the economic structure, and
      by the fact that the Synods, except at Geneva, being concerned not to
      reform society, but merely to repress the grosser kinds of scandal, dealt
      only with matters on which specific guidance was demanded by the
      Churches.</p>
      <p>Even so, however, the riddles to be solved were not a few. What is to
      be the attitude of the Churches towards<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> those who have grown rich on ill-gotten
      wealth? May pirates and fraudulent tradesmen be admitted to the Lord’s
      Supper? May the brethren trade with such persons, or do they share their
      sin if they buy their goods? The law of the State allows moderate
      interest: what is to be the attitude of the Church? What is to be done to
      prevent craftsmen cheating the consumer with shoddy wares, and tradesmen
      oppressing him with extortionate profits? Are lotteries permissible? Is it
      legitimate to invest at interest monies bequeathed for the benefit of the
      poor? The answers which the French Synods made to such questions show the
      persistence of the idea that the transactions of business are the province
      of the Church, combined with a natural desire to avoid an impracticable
      rigor. All persons who have wrung wealth unjustly from others must make
      restitution before they be admitted to communion, but their goods may be
      bought by the faithful, provided that the sale is public and approved by
      the civil authorities. Makers of fraudulent wares are to be censured, and
      tradesmen are to seek only “indifferent gain.” On the question of usury,
      the same division of opinion is visible in the French Reformed Church as
      existed at the same time in England and Holland, and Calvin’s advice on
      the subject was requested. The stricter school would not hear of confining
      the prohibition of usury to “excessive and scandalous” exactions, or of
      raising money for the poor by interest on capital. In France, however, as
      elsewhere, the day for these heroic rigors had passed, and the
      common-sense view prevailed. The brethren were required to demand no more
      than the law allowed and than was consistent with charity. Within these
      limits interest was not to be condemned.[<a href="#footnote-2-80"
      id="noteref-2-80">80</a>]</p>
      <p>Of the treatment of questions of this order by English Puritanism
      something is said in a subsequent chapter. In Scotland the views of the
      reformers as to economic ethics did not differ in substance from those of
      the Church before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> the
      Reformation, and the Scottish Book of Discipline denounced covetousness
      with the same vehemence as did the “accursed Popery” which it had
      overthrown. Gentlemen are exhorted to be content with their rents, and the
      Churches are required to make provision for the poor. “Oppression of the
      poor by exactions,” it is declared, “[and] deceiving of them in buying or
      selling by wrong mete or measure ... do properly appertain to the Church
      of God, to punish the same as God’s word commandeth.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-81" id="noteref-2-81">81</a>] The interpretation given
      to these offences is shown by the punishment of a usurer and of a
      defaulting debtor before the Kirk Sessions of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrews.[<a href="#footnote-2-82"
      id="noteref-2-82">82</a>] The relief of the poor was in 1579 made the
      statutory duty of ecclesiastical authorities in Scotland, seven years
      after it had in England been finally transferred to the State. The
      arrangement under which in rural districts it reposed down to 1846 on the
      shoulders of ministers, elders and deacons, was a survival from an age in
      which the real State in Scotland had been represented, not by Parliament
      or Council, but by the Church of Knox.</p>
      <p>Of English-speaking communities, that in which the social discipline of
      the Calvinist Church-State was carried to the furthest extreme was the
      Puritan theocracy of New England. Its practice had more affinity with the
      iron rule of Calvin’s Geneva than with the individualistic tendencies of
      contemporary English Puritanism. In that happy, bishopless Eden, where men
      desired only to worship God “according to the simplicitie of the gospel
      and to be ruled by the laws of God’s word,”[<a href="#footnote-2-83"
      id="noteref-2-83">83</a>] not only were “tobacco and immodest fashions and
      costly apparel,” and “that vain custom of drinking one to another,”
      forbidden to true professors, but the Fathers adopted towards that
      “notorious evil ... whereby most men walked in all their commerce—to buy
      as cheap and sell as dear as they can,”[<a href="#footnote-2-84"
      id="noteref-2-84">84</a>] an attitude which possibly would not be wholly
      congenial to their more business-like descendants. At an early date in the
      history of Massachusetts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg
      128]</span> a minister had called attention to the recrudescence of the
      old Adam—“profit being the chief aim and not the propagation of
      religion”—and Governor Bradford, observing uneasily how men grew “in their
      outward estates,” remarked that the increase in material prosperity “will
      be the ruin of New England, at least of the Churches of God there.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-85" id="noteref-2-85">85</a>] Sometimes Providence smote
      the exploiter. The immigrant who organized the first American Trust—he
      owned the only milch cow on board and sold the milk at 2<i><abbr
      title="pence">d.</abbr></i> a quart—“being after at a sermon wherein
      oppression was complained of ... fell distracted.”[<a
      href="#footnote-2-86" id="noteref-2-86">86</a>] Those who escaped the
      judgment of Heaven had to face the civil authorities and the Church,
      which, in the infancy of the colony, were the same thing.</p>
      <p>Naturally the authorities regulated prices, limited the rate of
      interest, fixed a maximum wage, and whipped incorrigible idlers; for these
      things had been done even in the house of bondage from which they fled.
      What was more distinctive of the children of light was their attempt to
      apply the same wholesome discipline to the elusive category of business
      profits. The price of cattle, the Massachusetts authorities decreed, was
      to be determined, not by the needs of the buyer, but so as to yield no
      more than a reasonable return to the seller.[<a href="#footnote-2-87"
      id="noteref-2-87">87</a>] Against those who charged more, their wrath was
      that of Moses descending to find the chosen people worshipping a golden
      calf. What little emotion they had to spare from their rage against
      religious freedom, they turned against economic license. Roger Williams
      touched a real affinity when, in his moving plea for tolerance, he argued
      that, though extortion was an evil, it was an evil the treatment of which
      should be left to the discretion of the civil authorities.[<a
      href="#footnote-2-88" id="noteref-2-88">88</a>]</p>
      <p>Consider the case of Mr. Robert Keane. His offence, by general consent,
      was black. He kept a shop in Boston, in<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span> which he took “in some ... above 6<i><abbr
      title="pence">d.</abbr></i> in the shilling profit; in some above
      8<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i>; and in some small things above two
      for one”; and this, though he was “an ancient professor of the gospel, a
      man of eminent parts, wealthy and having but one child, having come over
      for conscience’ sake and for the advancement of the gospel.” The scandal
      was terrible. Profiteers were unpopular—“the cry of the country was great
      against oppression”—and the grave elders reflected that a reputation for
      greed would injure the infant community, lying as it did “under the
      curious observation of all Churches and civil States in the world.” In
      spite of all, the magistrates were disposed to be lenient. There was no
      positive law in force limiting profits; it was not easy to determine what
      profits were fair; the sin of charging what the market could stand was not
      peculiar to Mr. Keane; and, after all, the law of God required no more
      than double restitution. So they treated him mercifully, and fined him
      only £200.</p>
      <p>Here, if he had been wise, Mr. Keane would have let the matter drop.
      But, like some others in a similar position, he damned himself
      irretrievably by his excuses. Summoned before the church of Boston, he
      first of all “did with tears acknowledge and bewail his covetous and
      corrupt heart,” and then was rash enough to venture on an explanation, in
      which he argued that the tradesman must live, and how could he live, if he
      might not make up for a loss on one article by additional profit on
      another? Here was a text on which no faithful pastor could refrain from
      enlarging. The minister of Boston pounced on the opportunity, and took
      occasion “in his public exercise the next lecture day to lay open the
      error of such false principles, and to give some rules of direction in the
      case. Some false principles were these:—<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span> “1. That a man might sell as dear as he can,
      and buy as cheap as he can. “2. If a man lose by casualty of sea, etc., in
      some of his commodities, he may raise the price of the rest. “3. That he
      may sell as he bought, though he paid too dear, and though the commodity
      be fallen, etc. “4. That, as a man may take the advantage of his own skill
      or ability, so he may of another’s ignorance or necessity. “5. Where one
      gives time for payment, he is to take like recompence of one as of
      another.”</p>
      <p>The rules for trading were not less explicit:— “1. A man may not sell
      above the current price, i.e., such a price as is usual in the time and
      place, and as another (who knows the worth of the commodity) would give
      for it if he had occasion to use it; as that is called current money which
      every man will take, etc. “2. When a man loseth in his commodity for want
      of skill, etc., he must look at it as his own fault or cross, and
      therefore must not lay it upon another. “3. Where a man loseth by casualty
      of sea, etc., it is a loss cast upon himself by Providence, and he may not
      ease himself of it by casting it upon another; for so a man should seem to
      provide against all providences, etc., that he should never lose; but
      where there is a scarcity of the commodity, there men may raise their
      price; for now it is a hand of God upon the commodity, and not the person.
      “4. A man may not ask any more for his commodity than his selling price,
      as Ephron to Abraham: the land is worth thus much.”</p>
      <p>It is unfortunate that the example of Ephron was not remembered in the
      case of transactions affecting the lands of Indians, to which it might
      have appeared peculiarly appropriate. In negotiating with these children
      of the devil, however, the saints of God considered the dealings of Israel
      with Gibeon a more appropriate precedent.</p>
      <p>The sermon was followed by an animated debate within<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
      the church. It was moved, amid quotations from 1 Cor. <abbr
      title="5">v</abbr>. 11, that Mr. Keane should be excommunicated. That he
      might be excommunicated, if he were a covetous person within the meaning
      of the text, was doubted as little as that he had recently given a
      pitiable exhibition of covetousness. The question was only whether he had
      erred through ignorance or careless, or whether he had acted “against his
      conscience or the very light of nature”—whether, in short, his sin was
      accidental or a trade. In the end he escaped with his fine and
      admonition.[<a href="#footnote-2-89" id="noteref-2-89">89</a>]</p>
      <p>If the only Christian documents which survived were the New Testament
      and the records of the Calvinist Churches in the age of the Reformation,
      to suggest a connection between them more intimate than a coincidence of
      phraseology would appear, in all probability, a daring extravagance.
      Legalistic, mechanical, without imagination or compassion, the work of a
      jurist and organizer of genius, Calvin’s system was more Roman than
      Christian, and more Jewish than either. That it should be as much more
      tyrannical than the medieval Church, as the Jacobin Club was than the <i
      lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, was inevitable. Its meshes were finer, its
      zeal and its efficiency greater. And its enemies were not merely actions
      and writings, but thoughts.</p>
      <p>The tyranny with which it is reproached by posterity would have been
      regarded by its champions as a compliment. In the struggle between liberty
      and authority, Calvinism sacrificed liberty, not with reluctance, but with
      enthusiasm. For the Calvinist Church was an army marching back to Canaan,
      under orders delivered once for all from Sinai, and the aim of its leaders
      was the conquest of the Promised Land, not the consolation of stragglers
      or the encouragement of laggards. In war the classical expedient is a
      dictatorship. The dictatorship of the ministry appeared as inevitable to
      the whole-hearted Calvinist as the Committee of Public Safety to the men
      of 1793, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
      dictatorship of the proletariat to an enthusiastic Bolshevik. If it
      reached its zenith where Calvin’s discipline was accepted without Calvin’s
      culture and intellectual range, in the orgies of devil worship with which
      a Cotton and an Endicott shocked at last even the savage superstition of
      New England, that result was only to be expected.</p>
      <p>The best that can be said of the social theory and practice of early
      Calvinism is that they were consistent. Most tyrannies have contented
      themselves with tormenting the poor. Calvinism had little pity for
      poverty; but it distrusted wealth, as it distrusted all influences that
      distract the aim or relax the fibers of the soul, and, in the first flush
      of its youthful austerity, it did its best to make life unbearable for the
      rich. Before the Paradise of earthly comfort it hung a flaming brand,
      waved by the implacable shades of Moses and Aaron.[<a

      <hr>
      <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>The ecclesiastical
      and political controversies which descend from the sixteenth century have
      thrust into oblivion all issues of less perennial interest. But the
      discussions which were motived by changes in the texture of society and
      the relations of classes were keen and continuous, nor was their result
      without significance for the future. In England, as on the Continent, the
      new economic realities came into sharp collision with the social theory
      inherited from the Middle Ages. The result was a re-assertion of the
      traditional doctrines with an almost tragic intensity of emotion, their
      gradual retreat before the advance of new conceptions, both of economic
      organization and of the province of religion, and their final decline from
      a militant creed into a kind of pious antiquarianism. They lingered,
      venerable ghosts, on the lips of churchmen down to the Civil War. Then the
      storm blew and they flickered out.</p>
      <p>Medieval England had lain on the outer edge of economic civilization,
      remote from the great highways of commerce and the bustling financial
      centers of Italy and Germany. With the commercial revolution which
      followed the Discoveries, a new age began. After the first outburst of
      curiosity, interest in explorations which yielded no immediate return of
      treasure died down. It was not till more than half a century later, when
      the silver of the New World was dazzling all Europe, that Englishmen
      reflected that it might conceivably have been lodged in the Tower instead
      of at Seville, and that talk of competition for America and the East began
      in earnest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, every other aspect of English economic life
      was in process of swift transformation. Foreign trade increased largely in
      the first half of the sixteenth century, and, as manufactures developed,
      cloth displaced wool as the principal export. With the growth of commerce
      went the growth of the financial organization on which commerce depends,
      and English capital poured into the growing London money-market, which had
      previously been dominated by Italian bankers. At home, with the expansion
      of internal trade which followed the Tudor peace, opportunities of
      speculation were increased, and a new class of middlemen arose to exploit
      them. In industry, the rising interest was that of the commercial
      capitalist, bent on securing the freedom to grow to what stature he could,
      and produce by what methods he pleased. Hampered by the defensive
      machinery of the gilds, with their corporate discipline, their organized
      torpor restricting individual enterprise, and their rough equalitarianism,
      either he quietly evaded gild regulations by withdrawing from the
      corporate towns, within which alone the pressure of economic conformity
      could be made effective, or he accepted the gild organization, captured
      its government, and by means of it developed a system under which the
      craftsman, even if nominally a master, was in effect the servant of an
      employer. In agriculture, the customary organization of the village was
      being sapped from below and battered down from above. For a prosperous
      peasantry, who had commuted the labor services that were still the rule in
      France and Germany, were rearranging their strips by exchange or
      agreement, and lords, no longer petty sovereigns, but astute business men,
      were leasing their demesnes to capitalist farmers, quick to grasp the
      profits to be won by sheep-grazing, and eager to clear away the network of
      communal restrictions which impeded its extension. Into commerce, industry
      and agriculture alike, the revolution in prices, gradual<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> for the first third of the
      century, but after 1540 a mill race, injected a virus of hitherto
      unsuspected potency, at once a stimulant to feverish enterprise and an
      acid dissolving all customary relationships.</p>
      <p>It was a society in rapid motion, swayed by new ambitions and haunted
      by new terrors, in which both success and failure had changed their
      meaning. Except in the turbulent north, the aim of the great landowner was
      no longer to hold at his call an army of retainers, but to exploit his
      estates as a judicious investment. The prosperous merchant, once content
      to win a position of dignity and power in fraternity or town, now flung
      himself into the task of carving his way to solitary preëminence, unaided
      by the artificial protection of gild or city. To the immemorial poverty of
      peasant and craftsman, pitting, under the ever-present threat of famine,
      their pigmy forces against an implacable nature, was added the haunting
      insecurity of a growing, though still small, proletariat, detached from
      their narrow niche in village or borough, the sport of social forces which
      they could neither understand, nor arrest, nor control.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-3-1"><abbr title="1">I</abbr>. THE LAND QUESTION</h3>
      <p>The England of the Reformation, to which posterity turns as a source of
      high debates on church government and doctrine, was to contemporaries a
      cauldron seething with economic unrest and social passions. But the
      material on which agitation fed had been accumulating for three
      generations, and of the grievances which exploded in the middle of the
      century, with the exception of the depreciation of the currency, there was
      not one—neither enclosures and pasture farming, nor usury, nor the
      malpractices of gilds, nor the rise in prices, nor the oppression of
      craftsmen by merchants, nor the extortions of the engrosser—which had not
      evoked popular protests, been denounced by publicists, and produced<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span> legislation and
      administrative action, long before the Reformation Parliament met. The
      floods were already running high, when the religious revolution swelled
      them with a torrent of bitter, if bracing, waters. Its effect on the
      social situation was twofold. Since it produced a sweeping redistribution
      of wealth, carried out by an unscrupulous minority using the weapons of
      violence, intimidation and fraud, and succeeded by an orgy of interested
      misgovernment on the part of its principal beneficiaries, it aggravated
      every problem, and gave a new turn to the screw which was squeezing
      peasant and craftsman. Since it released a torrent of writing on questions
      not only of religion, but of social organization, it caused the criticisms
      passed on the changes of the past half-century to be brought to a head in
      a sweeping indictment of the new economic forces and an eloquent
      restatement of the traditional theory of social obligations. The center of
      both was the land question. For it was agrarian plunder which principally
      stirred the cupidity of the age, and agrarian grievances which were the
      most important ground of social agitation.</p>
      <p>The land question had been a serious matter for the greater part of a
      century before the Reformation. The first detailed account of enclosure
      had been written by a chantry priest in Warwickshire, soon after 1460.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-1" id="noteref-3-1">1</a>] Then had come the legislation
      of 1489, 1515 and 1516, Wolsey’s Royal Commission in 1517, and more
      legislation in 1534.[<a href="#footnote-3-2" id="noteref-3-2">2</a>]
      Throughout, a steady stream of criticism had flowed from men of the
      Renaissance, like More, Starkey and a host of less well-known writers,
      dismayed at the advance of social anarchy, and sanguine of the miracles to
      be performed by a Prince who would take counsel of philosophers.</p>
      <p>If, however, the problem was acute long before the confiscation of the
      monastic estates, its aggravation by the fury of spoliation let loose by
      Henry and Cromwell is not open to serious question. It is a mistake, no
      doubt, to see the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
      days of monasticism through rose-colored spectacles. The monks, after all,
      were business men, and the lay agents whom they often employed to manage
      their property naturally conformed to the agricultural practice of the
      world around them. In Germany revolts were nowhere more frequent or more
      bitter than on the estates of ecclesiastical landowners.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-3" id="noteref-3-3">3</a>] In England a glance at the
      proceedings of the Courts of Star Chamber and Requests is enough to show
      that holy men reclaimed villeins, turned copyholders into tenants at will,
      and, as More complained, converted arable land to pasture.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-4" id="noteref-3-4">4</a>]</p>
      <p>In reality, the supposition of unnatural virtue on the part of the
      monks, or of more than ordinary harshness on the part of the new
      proprietors, is not needed in order to explain the part which the rapid
      transference of great masses of property played in augmenting rural
      distress. The worst side of all such sudden and sweeping redistributions
      is that the individual is more or less at the mercy of the market, and can
      hardly help taking his pound of flesh. Estates with a capital value (in
      terms of modern money) of £15,000,000 to £20,000,000 changed hands.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-5" id="noteref-3-5">5</a>] To the abbey lands which came
      into the market after 1536 were added those of the gilds and chantries in
      1547. The financial necessities of the Crown were too pressing to allow of
      its retaining them in its own possession and drawing the rents; nor, in
      any case, would that have been the course dictated by prudence to a
      Government which required a party to carry through a revolution. What it
      did, therefore, was to alienate most of the land almost immediately, and
      to spend the capital as income. For a decade there was a mania of land
      speculation. Much of the property was bought by needy courtiers, at a
      ridiculously low figure. Much of it passed to sharp business men, who
      brought to bear on its management the methods learned in the financial
      school of the City; the largest single grantee was Sir Richard
      Gresham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> Much was
      acquired by middlemen, who bought scattered parcels of land, held them for
      the rise, and disposed of them piecemeal when they got a good offer; in
      London, groups of tradesmen—cloth-workers, leather-sellers, merchant
      tailors, brewers, tallow-chandlers—formed actual syndicates to exploit the
      market. Rack-renting, evictions, and the conversions of arable to pasture
      were the natural result, for surveyors wrote up values at each transfer,
      and, unless the last purchaser squeezed his tenants, the transaction would
      not pay.[<a href="#footnote-3-6" id="noteref-3-6">6</a>]</p>
      <p>Why, after all, should a landlord be more squeamish than the Crown? “Do
      ye not know,” said the grantee of one of the Sussex manors of the
      monastery of Sion, in answer to some peasants who protested at the seizure
      of their commons, “that the King’s Grace hath put down all the houses of
      monks, friars and nuns? Therefore now is the time come that we gentlemen
      will pull down the houses of such poor knaves as ye be.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-7" id="noteref-3-7">7</a>] Such arguments, if
      inconsequent, were too convenient not to be common. The protests of
      contemporaries receive detailed confirmation from the bitter struggles
      which can be traced between the peasantry and some of the new
      landlords—the Herberts, who enclosed a whole village to make the park at
      Washerne, in which, according to tradition, the gentle Sidney was to write
      his
      <i>Arcadia</i>, the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Johns at Abbot’s
      Ripton, and Sir John Yorke, third in the line of speculators in the lands
      of Whitby Abbey, whose tenants found their rents raised from £29 to £64 a
      year, and for nearly twenty years were besieging the Government with
      petitions for redress.[<a href="#footnote-3-8" id="noteref-3-8">8</a>] The
      legend, still repeated late in the seventeenth century, that the grantees
      of monastic estates died out in three generations, though unveracious, is
      not surprising. The wish was father to the thought.</p>
      <p>It was an age in which the popular hatred of the encloser and the
      engrosser found a natural ally in religious sentiment,<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> schooled, as it was, in a
      tradition which had taught that the greed of gain was a deadly sin, and
      that the plea of economic self-interest did not mitigate the verdict, but
      aggravated the offence. In England, as on the Continent, doctrinal
      radicalism marched hand in hand with social conservatism. The most
      scathing attack on social disorders came, not from the partisans of the
      old religion, but from divines on the left wing of the Protestant party,
      who saw in economic individualism but another expression of the laxity and
      license which had degraded the purity of religion, and who understood by
      reformation a return to the moral austerity of the primitive Church, no
      less than to its government and doctrine. The touching words[<a
      href="#footnote-3-9" id="noteref-3-9">9</a>] in which the leader of the
      Pilgrimage of Grace painted the social effects of the dissolution of the
      Yorkshire monasteries were mild compared with the denunciations launched
      ten years later by Latimer, Crowley, Lever, Becon and Ponet.</p>
      <p>Their passion was natural. What Aske saw in the green tree, they saw in
      the dry, and their horror at the plunge into social immorality was
      sharpened by the bitterness of disappointed hopes. It was all to have been
      so different! The movement which produced the Reformation was a Janus, not
      with two, but with several, faces, and among them had been one which
      looked wistfully for a political and social regeneration as the fruit of
      the regeneration of religion.[<a href="#footnote-3-10"
      id="noteref-3-10">10</a>] In England, as in Germany and Switzerland, men
      had dreamed of a Reformation which would reform the State and society, as
      well as the Church. The purification, not merely of doctrine, but of
      morals, the encouragement of learning, the diffusion of education, the
      relief of poverty, by the stirring into life of a mass of sleeping
      endowments, a spiritual and social revival inspired by the revival of the
      faith of the Gospel—such, not without judicious encouragement from a
      Government alert to play on public opinion,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> was the vision which had floated before the
      eyes of the humanitarian and the idealist.</p>
      <p>It did not vanish without a struggle. At the very height of the
      economic crisis, Bucer, the tutor of Edward <abbr title="the
      sixth">VI</abbr>, and Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, stated the
      social program of a Christian renaissance in the manual of Christian
      politics which he drafted in order to explain to his pupil how the Kingdom
      of Christ might be established by a Christian prince. Its outlines were
      sharpened, and its details elaborated, with all the remorseless precision
      of a disciple of Calvin. Willful idlers are to be excommunicated by the
      Church and punished by the State. The Government, a pious mercantilist, is
      to revive the woollen industry, to introduce the linen industry, to insist
      on pasture being put under the plow. It is to take a high line with the
      commercial classes. For, though trade in itself is honorable, most traders
      are rogues—indeed “next to the sham priests, no class of men is more
      pestilential to the Commonwealth”; their works are usury, monopolies, and
      the bribery of Governments to overlook both. Fortunately, the remedies are
      simple. The State must fix just prices—“a very necessary but an easy
      matter.” Only “pious persons, devoted to the Commonwealth more than to
      their own interests,” are to be allowed to engage in trade at all. In
      every village and town a school is to be established under a master
      eminent for piety and wisdom. “Christian princes must above all things
      strive that men of virtue may abound, and live to the glory of God....
      Neither the Church of Christ, nor a Christian Commonwealth, ought to
      tolerate such as prefer private gain to the public weal, or seek it to the
      hurt of their neighbors.”[<a href="#footnote-3-11"
      id="noteref-3-11">11</a>]</p>
      <p>The Christian prince strove, but not, poor child, as those that
      prevail. The classes whose backing was needed to make the Reformation a
      political success had sold their support on terms which made it inevitable
      that it should be a social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg
      143]</span> disaster. The upstart aristocracy of the future had their
      teeth in the carcass, and, having tasted blood, they were not to be
      whipped off by a sermon. The Government of Edward <abbr title="the
      sixth">VI</abbr>, like all Tudor Governments, made its experiment in
      fixing just prices. What the astute Gresham, its financial adviser,
      thought of restricting commerce to persons of piety, we do not know, but
      can guess. As for the schools, what it did for them Mr. Leach has told us.
      It swept them away wholesale in order to distribute their endowments among
      courtiers. There were probably more schools in proportion to the
      population at the end of the fifteenth century than there were in the
      middle of the nineteenth. “These endowments were confiscated by the State,
      and many still line the pockets of the descendants of the statesmen of the
      day.”[<a href="#footnote-3-12" id="noteref-3-12">12</a>] “King Edward
      <abbr title="the sixth">VI</abbr>’s Grammar Schools” are the schools which
      King Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI</abbr> did not destroy.</p>
      <p>The disillusionment was crushing. Was it surprising that the reformers
      should ask what had become of the devout imaginations of social
      righteousness, which were to have been realized as the result of a godly
      reformation? The end of Popery, the curtailment of ecclesiastical
      privileges, six new bishoprics, lectureships in Greek and Latin in place
      of the disloyal subject of the canon law, the reform of doctrine and
      ritual—side by side with these good things had come some less edifying
      changes, the ruin of much education, the cessation of much charity, a raid
      on corporate property which provoked protests even in the House of
      Commons,[<a href="#footnote-3-13" id="noteref-3-13">13</a>] and for ten
      years a sinister hum, as of the floating of an immense land syndicate,
      with favorable terms for all sufficiently rich, or influential, or mean,
      to get in on the ground floor. The men who had invested in the Reformation
      when it was still a gambling stock naturally nursed the security, and
      denounced the revolting peasants as communists, with the mystical
      reverence for the rights of property which is characteristic in all ages
      of the <i lang="fr">nouveaux<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg
      144]</span> riches</i>.[<a href="#footnote-3-14" id="noteref-3-14">14</a>]
      The men whose religion was not money said what they thought of the
      business in pamphlets and sermons, which left respectable congregations
      spluttering with fury.</p>
      <p>Crowley pilloried lease-mongers and usurers, wrote that the sick begged
      in the street because rich men had seized the endowments of hospitals, and
      did not conceal his sympathy with the peasants who rose under Ket.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-15" id="noteref-3-15">15</a>] Becon told the gentry,
      eloquent on the vices of abbey-lubbers, that the only difference between
      them and the monks was that they were more greedy and more useless, more
      harsh in wringing the last penny from the tenants, more selfish in
      spending the whole income on themselves, more pitiless to the poor.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-16" id="noteref-3-16">16</a>] “In suppressing of abbies,
      cloisters, colleges and chantries,” preached Lever in <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s, “the intent of the King’s Majesty that
      dead is, was, and of this our king now is, very godly, and the purpose, or
      else the pretence, of other wondrous goodly: that thereby such abundance
      of goods as was superstitiously spent upon vain ceremonies, or
      voluptuously upon idle bellies, might come to the king’s hands to bear his
      great charges, necessarily bestowed in the common wealth, or partly unto
      other men’s hands, for the better relief of the poor, the maintenance of
      learning, and the setting forth of God’s word. Howbeit, covetous officers
      have so used this matter, that even those goods which did serve to the
      relief of the poor, the maintenance of learning, and to comfortable
      necessary hospitality in the common wealth, be now turned to maintain
      worldly, wicked, covetous ambition.... You which have gotten these goods
      into your own hands, to turn them from evil to worse, and other goods more
      from good unto evil, be ye sure it is even you that have offended God,
      beguiled the king, robbed the rich, spoiled the poor, and brought a common
      wealth into a common misery.”[<a href="#footnote-3-17"
      id="noteref-3-17">17</a>]</p>
      <p>This was plain speaking indeed. Known to their enemies<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
      as the “Commonwealth men” from their advocacy of social reconstruction,
      the group of which Latimer was the prophet and Hales the man of action
      naturally incurred the charge of stirring up class hatred, which is
      normally brought against all who call attention to its causes. The result
      of their activity was the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire
      into offences against the Acts forbidding the conversion of arable to
      pasture, the introduction of legislation requiring the maintenance of
      tillage and rebuilding of cottages, and a proclamation pardoning persons
      who had taken the law into their own hands by pulling down hedges. The
      gentry were furious. Paget, the secretary to the Council, who was quite
      ready for a reign of terror, provided that the gentlemen began it,
      prophesied gloomily that the German Peasants’ War was to be reënacted in
      England; the Council, most of whose members held abbey lands, was sullen;
      and Warwick, the personification of the predatory property of the day,
      attacked Hales fiercely for carrying out, as chairman of the Midland
      committee of the Depopulation Commission, the duties laid upon him by the
      Government. “Sir,” wrote a plaintiff gentleman to Cecil, “be plain with my
      Lord’s Grace, that under the pretense of simplicity and poverty there may
      [not] rest much mischief. So do I fear there doth in these men called
      Common Wealths and their adherents. To declare unto you the state of the
      gentlemen (I mean as well the greatest as the lowest), I assure you they
      are in such doubt, that almost they dare touch none of them [i.e., the
      peasants], not for that they are afraid of them, but for that some of them
      have been sent up and come away without punishment, and that Common Wealth
      called Latimer hath gotten the pardon of others.”[<a href="#footnote-3-18"
      id="noteref-3-18">18</a>]</p>
      <p>The “Common Wealth called Latimer” was unrepentant. Combining gifts of
      humor and invective which are not very common among bishops, his fury at
      oppression did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span> not
      prevent him from greeting the Devil with a burst of uproarious laughter,
      as of a satyrical gargoyle carved to make the sinner ridiculous in this
      world before he is damned in the next. So he was delighted when he
      provoked one of his audience into the exclamation, “Mary, a seditious
      fellow!” used the episode as comic relief in his next sermon,[<a
      href="#footnote-3-19" id="noteref-3-19">19</a>] and then, suddenly
      serious, redoubled his denunciations of step-lords and rent-raisers. Had
      not the doom of the covetous been pronounced by Christ Himself?</p>

      <p>On the technicalities of the Tudor land question the authors of such
      outbursts spoke without authority, and, thanks to Mr. Leadam and Professor
      Gay, modern research has found no difficulty in correcting the perspective
      of their story. At once incurious and ill-informed as to the large
      impersonal causes which were hurrying forward the reorganization of
      agriculture on a commercial basis, what shocked them was not only the
      material misery of their age, but its repudiation of the principles by
      which alone, as it seemed, human society is distinguished from a pack of
      wolves. Their enemy was not merely the Northumberlands or Herberts, but an
      idea, and they sprang to the attack, less of spoliation or tyranny, than
      of a creed which was the parent of both. That creed was that the
      individual is absolute master of his own, and, within the limits set by
      positive law, may exploit it with a single eye to his pecuniary advantage,
      unrestrained by any obligation to postpone his own profit to the
      well-being of his neighbors, or to give<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> account of his actions to a higher
      authority. It was, in short, the theory of property which was later to be
      accepted by all civilized communities.</p>
      <p>The question of the respective rights of lord and peasant had never, at
      least within recent centuries, arisen in so acute a form, for, as long as
      the customary tenants were part of the stock of the manor, it was
      obviously to the interest of the lord to bind them to the soil. Now all
      that had been changed, at any rate in the south and midlands, by the
      expansion of the woollen industry and the devaluation of money. Chevage
      and merchet had gone; forced labor, if it had not gone, was fast going.
      The psychology of landowning had been revolutionized, and for two
      generations the sharp landlord, instead of using his seigneurial right to
      fine or arrest run-aways from the villein nest, had been hunting for flaws
      in titles, screwing up admission fines, twisting manorial customs, and,
      when he dared, turning copyholds into leases. The official opposition to
      depopulation, which had begun in 1489 and was to last almost till 1640,
      infuriated him, as an intolerable interference with the rights of
      property. In their attacks on the restraints imposed by village custom
      from below and by the Crown from above, in their illegal defiance of the
      statutes forbidding depopulation, and in their fierce resistance to the
      attempts of Wolsey and Somerset to restore the old order, the interests
      which were making the agrarian revolution were watering the seeds of that
      individualistic conception of ownership which was to carry all before it
      after the Civil War. With such a doctrine, since it denied both the
      existence and the necessity of a moral title, it was not easy for any
      religion less pliant than that of the eighteenth century to make a truce.
      Once accepted, it was to silence the preaching of all social duties save
      that of submission. If property be an unconditional right, emphasis on its
      obligations is little more than the graceful parade of a<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> flattering, but innocuous,
      metaphor. For, whether the obligations are fulfilled or neglected, the
      right continues unchallenged and indefeasible.</p>
      <p>A religious theory of society necessarily regards with suspicion all
      doctrines which claim a large space for the unfettered play of economic
      self-interest. To the latter the end of activity is the satisfaction of
      desires, to the former the felicity of man consists in the discharge of
      obligations imposed by God. Viewing the social order as the imperfect
      reflection of a divine plan, it naturally attaches a high value to the
      arts by which nature is harnessed to the service of mankind. But, more
      concerned with ends than with means, it regards temporal goods as at best
      instrumental to a spiritual purpose, and its standpoint is that of Bacon,
      when he spoke of the progress of knowledge as being sought for “the glory
      of the Creator and the relief of man’s estate.” To a temper nurtured on
      such ideas, the new agrarian <i lang="fr">régime</i>, with its sacrifice
      of the village—a fellowship of mutual aid, a partnership of service and
      protection, “a little commonwealth”—to the pecuniary interests of a great
      proprietor, who made a desert where men had worked and prayed, seemed a
      defiance, not only of man, but of God. It was the work of “men that live
      as thoughe there were no God at all, men that would have all in their owne
      handes, men that would leave nothyng for others, men that would be alone
      on the earth, men that bee never satisfied.”[<a href="#footnote-3-21"
      id="noteref-3-21">21</a>] Its essence was an attempt to extend legal
      rights, while repudiating legal and quasi-legal obligations. It was
      against this new idolatry of irresponsible ownership, a growing, but not
      yet triumphant, creed, that the divines of the Reformation called down
      fire from heaven.</p>
      <p>Their doctrine was derived from the conception of property, of which
      the most elaborate formulation had been made by the Schoolmen, and which,
      while justifying it on grounds of experience and expediency, insisted that
      its use was limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> at
      every turn by the rights of the community and the obligations of charity.
      Its practical application was an idealized version of the feudal order,
      which was vanishing before the advance of more business-like and
      impersonal forms of landownership, and which, once an engine of
      exploitation, was now hailed as a bulwark to protect the weak against the
      downward thrust of competition. Society is a hierarchy of rights and
      duties. Law exists to enforce the second, as much as to protect the first.
      Property is not a mere aggregate of economic privileges, but a responsible
      office. Its <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> is not only income, but
      service. It is to secure its owner such means, and no more than such
      means, as may enable him to perform those duties, whether labor on the
      land, or labor in government, which are involved in the particular status
      which he holds in the system. He who seeks more robs his superiors, or his
      dependents, or both. He who exploits his property with a single eye to its
      economic possibilities at once perverts its very essence and destroys his
      own moral title, for he has “every man’s living and does no man’s
      duty.”[<a href="#footnote-3-22" id="noteref-3-22">22</a>]</p>
      <p>The owner is a trustee, whose rights are derived from the function
      which he performs and should lapse if he repudiates it. They are limited
      by his duty to the State; they are limited no less by the rights of his
      tenants against him. Just as the peasant may not cultivate his land in the
      way which he may think most profitable to himself, but is bound by the law
      of the village to grow the crops which the village needs and to throw his
      strips open after harvest to his neighbors’s beasts, so the lord is
      required both by custom and by statute to forego the anti-social profits
      to be won by methods of agriculture which injure his neighbors and weaken
      the State. He may not raise his rent or demand increased fines, for the
      function of the peasant, though different, is not less essential than his
      own. He is, in short, not a <i lang="fr">rentier</i>, but an officer, and
      it is for the Church to rebuke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg
      150]</span> him when he sacrifices the duties of his charge to the greed
      for personal gain. “We heartily pray thee to send thy holy spirit into the
      hearts of them that possess the grounds, pastures, and dwelling-places of
      the earth, that they, remembering themselves to be thy tenants, may not
      rack and stretch out the rents of their houses and lands, nor yet take
      unreasonable fines and incomes, after the manner of covetous worldlings
      ... but so behave themselves in letting out their tenements, lands and
      pastures, that after this life they may be received into everlasting
      dwelling places.”[<a href="#footnote-3-23" id="noteref-3-23">23</a>] Thus,
      while the covetous worldlings disposed the goods of this transitory life
      to their liking, did a pious monarch consider their eternal welfare in the
      Book of Private Prayer issued in 1553.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-3-2"><abbr title="2">II</abbr>. RELIGIOUS THEORY AND
      SOCIAL POLICY</h3>
      <p>If a philosophy of society is to be effective, it must be as mobile and
      realistic as the forces which it would control. The weakness of an
      attitude which met the onset of insurgent economic interests with a
      generalized appeal to traditional morality and an idealization of the past
      was only too obvious. Shocked, confused, thrown on to a helpless, if
      courageous and eloquent, defensive by changes even in the slowly moving
      world of agriculture, medieval social theory, to which the most
      representative minds of the English Church still clung, found itself swept
      off its feet after the middle of the century by the swift rise of a
      commercial civilization, in which all traditional landmarks seemed one by
      one to be submerged. The issue over which the struggle between the new
      economic movements of the age and the scheme of economic ethics expounded
      by churchmen was most definitely joined, and continued longest, was not,
      as the modern reader might be disposed to expect, that of wages, but that
      of credit, money-lending and prices. The<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> center of the controversy—the mystery of
      iniquity in which a host of minor scandals were conveniently, if
      inaccurately, epitomized—was the problem which contemporaries described by
      the word usury.</p>
      <p>“Treasure doth then advance greatness,” wrote Bacon, in words
      characteristic of the social ideal of the age, “when the wealth of the
      subject be rather in many hands than few.”[<a href="#footnote-3-24"
      id="noteref-3-24">24</a>] In spite of the growing concentration of
      property, Tudor England was still, to use a convenient modern phase, a
      Distributive State. It was a community in which the ownership of land, and
      of the simple tools used in most industries, was not the badge of a class,
      but the attribute of a society, and in which the typical worker was a
      peasant farmer, a tradesman, or a small master. In this world of small
      property-owners, of whose independence and prosperity English publicists
      boasted, in contrast with the “housed beggars” of France and Germany, the
      wage-earners were a minority scattered in the interstices of village and
      borough, and, being normally themselves the sons of peasants, with the
      prospect of stepping into a holding of their own, or, at worst, the chance
      of squatting on the waste, were often in a strong position
      <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> their employers. The special economic <i
      lang="fr">malaise</i> of an age is naturally the obverse of its special
      qualities. Except in certain branches of the textile industry, the
      grievance which supplied fuel to social agitation, which evoked programs
      of social reform, and which prompted both legislation and administrative
      activity, sprang, not from the exploitation of a wage-earning proletariat
      by its employers, but from the relation of the producer to the landlord of
      whom he held, the dealer with whom he bought and sold, and the local
      capitalist, often the dealer in another guise, to whom he ran into debt.
      The farmer must borrow money when the season is bad, or merely to finance
      the interval between sowing and harvest. The craftsman must buy raw
      materials on credit and get advances<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> before his wares are sold. The young
      tradesman must scrape together a little capital before he can set up shop.
      Even the cottager, who buys grain at the local market, must constantly ask
      the seller to “give day.” Almost every one, therefore, at one time or
      another, has need of the money-lender. And the lender is often a
      monopolist—“a money master,” a malster or corn monger, “a rich priest,”
      who is the solitary capitalist in a community of peasants and artisans.
      Naturally, he is apt to become their master.[<a href="#footnote-3-25"
      id="noteref-3-25">25</a>]</p>
      <p>In such circumstances it is not surprising that there should have been
      a popular outcry against extortion. Inspired by practical grievances, it
      found an ally, eloquent, if disarmed, in the teaching of the Church. The
      doctrine as to the ethics of economic conduct, which had been formulated
      by medieval Popes and interpreted by medieval Schoolmen, was rehearsed by
      the English divines of the sixteenth century, not merely as the
      conventional tribute paid by a formal piety to the wisdom of the past, but
      because the swift changes of the period in commerce and agriculture had,
      not softened, but accentuated, the problems of conduct for which it had
      been designed. Nor was it only against the particular case of the covetous
      money-lender that the preacher and the moralist directed their arrows. The
      essence of the medieval scheme of economic ethics had been its insistence
      on equity in bargaining—a contract is fair, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
      Thomas had said, when both parties gain from it equally. The prohibition
      of usury had been the kernel of its doctrines, not because the gains of
      the money-lender were the only species, but because, in the economic
      conditions of the age, they were the most conspicuous species, of
      extortion.</p>
      <p>In reality, alike in the Middle Ages and in the sixteenth century, the
      word usury had not the specialized sense which it carries today. Like the
      modern profiteer, the usurer was a character so unpopular that most
      unpopular characters could be called usurers, and by the average practical
      man almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> any form of
      bargain which he thought oppressive would be classed as usurious. The
      interpretation placed on the word by those who expounded ecclesiastical
      theories of usury was equally elastic. Not only the taking of interest for
      a loan, but the raising of prices by a monopolist, the beating down of
      prices by a keen bargainer, the rack-renting of land by a landlord, the
      sub-letting of land by a tenant at a rent higher than he himself paid, the
      cutting of wages and the paying of wages in truck, the refusal of discount
      to a tardy debtor, the insistence on unreasonably good security for a
      loan, the excessive profits of a middleman—all these had been denounced as
      usury in the very practical thirteenth-century manual of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Raymond;[<a href="#footnote-3-26"
      id="noteref-3-26">26</a>] all these were among the “unlawful chaffer,” the
      “sublety and sleight,” which was what the plain man who sat on juries and
      listened to sermons in parish churches meant by usury three centuries
      later. If he had been asked why usury was wrong, he would probably have
      answered with a quotation from Scripture. If he had been asked for a
      definition of usury, he would have been puzzled, and would have replied in
      the words of a member of Parliament who spoke on the bill introduced in
      1571: “It standeth doubtful what usury is; we have no true definition of
      it.”[<a href="#footnote-3-27" id="noteref-3-27">27</a>] The truth is,
      indeed, that any bargain, in which one party obviously gained more
      advantage than the other, and used his power to the full, was regarded as
      usurious. The description which best sums up alike popular sentiment and
      ecclesiastical teaching is contained in the comprehensive indictment
      applied by his parishioners to an unpopular divine who lent at a penny in
      the shilling—the cry of all poor men since the world began—Dr. Bennet “is
      a great taker of advantages.”[<a href="#footnote-3-28"
      id="noteref-3-28">28</a>]</p>
      <p>It was the fact that the theory of usury which the divines of the
      sixteenth century inherited was not an isolated freak of casuistical
      ingenuity, but one subordinate element in a comprehensive system of social
      philosophy, which gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
      its poignancy to the controversy of which it became the center. The
      passion which fed on its dusty dialectics was fanned by the conviction
      that the issue at stake was not merely a legal technicality. It was the
      fate of the whole scheme of medieval thought, which had attempted to treat
      economic affairs as part of a hierarchy of values, embracing all interests
      and activities, of which the apex was religion.</p>
      <p>If the Reformation was a revolution, it was a revolution which left
      almost intact both the lower ranges of ecclesiastical organization and the
      traditional scheme of social thought. The villager who, resisting the
      temptations of the alehouse, morris dancing or cards, attended his parish
      church from 1530 to 1560, must have been bewildered by a succession of
      changes in the appearance of the building and the form of the services.
      But there was little to make him conscious of any alteration in the social
      system of which the church was the center, or in the duties which that
      system imposed upon himself. After, as before, the Reformation, the parish
      continued to be a community in which religious and social obligations were
      inextricably intertwined, and it was as a parishioner, rather than as a
      subject of the secular authority, that he bore his share of public burdens
      and performed such public functions as fell to his lot. The officers of
      whom he saw most in the routine of his daily life were the churchwardens.
      The place where most public business was transacted, and where news of the
      doings of the great world came to him, was the parish church. The
      contributions levied from him were demanded in the name of the parish.
      Such education as was available for his children was often given by the
      curate or parish schoolmaster. Such training in coöperation with his
      fellows as he received sprang from common undertakings maintained by the
      parish, which owned property, received bequests, let out sheep and cattle,
      advanced money, made large profits by church ales, and occasionally
      engaged in trade.[<a href="#footnote-3-29" id="noteref-3-29">29</a>]
      Membership of the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg
      155]</span> and of the State being co-extensive and equally compulsory,
      the Government used the ecclesiastical organization of the parish for
      purposes which, in a later age, when the religious, political and economic
      aspects of life were disentangled, were to be regarded as secular. The
      pulpit was the channel through which official information was conveyed to
      the public and the duty of obedience inculcated. It was to the clergy and
      the parochial organization that the State turned in coping with pauperism,
      and down to 1597 collectors for the poor were chosen by the churchwardens
      in conjunction with the parson.</p>
      <p>Where questions of social ethics were concerned, the religious thought
      of the age was not less conservative than its ecclesiastical organization.
      Both in their view of religion as embracing all sides of life, and in
      their theory of the particular social obligations which religion involved,
      the most representative thinkers of the Church of England had no intention
      of breaking with traditional doctrines. In the rooted suspicion of
      economic motives which caused them to damn each fresh manifestation of the
      spirit of economic enterprise as a new form of the sin of covetousness, as
      in their insistence that the criteria of economic relations and of the
      social order were to be sought, not in practical expediency, but in truths
      of which the Church was the guardian and the exponent, the utterances of
      men of religion in the reign of Elizabeth, in spite of the revolution
      which had intervened, had more affinity with the doctrines of the
      Schoolmen than with those which were to be fashionable after the
      Restoration.</p>
      <p>The oppressions of the tyrannous landlord, who used his economic power
      to drive an unmerciful bargain, were the subject of constant denunciation
      down to the Civil War. The exactions of middlemen—“merchants of mischief
      ... [who] do make all things dear to the buyers, and yet wonderful vile
      and of small price to many that must needs<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> set or sell that which is their own honestly
      come by”—were pilloried by Lever.[<a href="#footnote-3-30"
      id="noteref-3-30">30</a>] Nicholas Heming, whose treatise on <i>The Lawful
      Use of Riches</i> became something like a standard work, expounded the
      doctrine of the just price, and swept impatiently aside the argument which
      pleaded freedom of contract as an excuse for covetousness: “Cloake the
      same by what title you liste, your synne is excedyng greate.... He which
      hurteth but one man is in a damnable case; what shall bee thought of thee,
      whiche bryngest whole householdes to their graves, or at the leaste art a
      meanes of their extreame miserie? Thou maiest finde shiftes to avoide the
      danger of men, but assuredly thou shalte not escape the judgemente of
      God.”[<a href="#footnote-3-31" id="noteref-3-31">31</a>] Men eminent among
      Anglican divines, such as Sandys and Jewel, took part in the controversy
      on the subject of usury. A bishop of Salisbury gave his blessing to the
      book of Wilson; an archbishop of Canterbury allowed Mosse’s sharp <i
      lang="fr">Arraignment</i> to be dedicated to himself; and a clerical
      pamphleteer in the seventeenth century produced a catalogue of six bishops
      and ten doctors of divinity—not to mention numberless humbler clergy—who
      had written in the course of the last hundred years on different aspects
      of the sin of extortion in all its manifold varieties.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-32" id="noteref-3-32">32</a>] The subject was still a
      favorite of the ecclesiastical orator. The sixteenth-century preacher was
      untrammeled by the convention which in a more fastidious age was to
      preclude as an impropriety the discussion in the pulpit of the problems of
      the market-place. “As it belongeth to the magistrate to punishe,” wrote
      Heming, “so it is the parte of the preachers to reprove usurie.... First,
      they should earnestly inveigh against all unlawfull and wicked
      contractes.... Let them ... amend all manifest errours in bargaining by
      ecclesiasticall discipline.... Then, if they cannot reforme all abuses
      which they shall finde in bargaines, let them take heede that they trouble
      not the Churche overmuche, but commende<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span> the cause unto God ... Last of all, let them
      with diligence admonishe the ritche men, that they suffer not themselves
      to be entangled with the shewe of ritches.”[<a href="#footnote-3-33"
      id="noteref-3-33">33</a>]</p>
      <p>“This,” wrote an Anglican divine in reference to the ecclesiastical
      condemnation of usury, “hath been the generall judgment of the Church for
      above this fifteene hundred yeeres, without opposition, in this point.
      Poor sillie Church of Christ, that could never finde a lawfull usurie
      before this golden age wherein we live.”[<a href="#footnote-3-34"
      id="noteref-3-34">34</a>] The first fact which strikes the modern student
      of this body of teaching is its continuity with the past. In its
      insistence that buying and selling, letting and hiring, lending and
      borrowing, are to be controlled by a moral law, of which the Church is the
      guardian, religious opinion after the Reformation did not differ from
      religious opinion before it. The reformers themselves were conscious,
      neither of the emancipation from the economic follies of the age of
      medieval darkness ascribed to them in the eighteenth century, nor of the
      repudiation of the traditional economic morality of Christendom, which
      some writers have held to have been the result of the revolt from Rome.
      The relation in which they conceived themselves to stand to the social
      theory of the medieval Church is shown by the authorities to whom they
      appealed. “Therefore I would not,” wrote Dr. Thomas Wilson, Master of
      Requests and for a short time Secretary of State, “have men altogether to
      be enemies to the canon lawe, and to condempne every thinge there written,
      because the Popes were aucthours of them, as though no good lawe coulde
      bee made by them.... Nay, I will saye playnely, that there are some suche
      lawes made by the Popes as be righte godly, saye others what they
      list.”[<a href="#footnote-3-35" id="noteref-3-35">35</a>] From the lips of
      a Tudor official, such sentiments fell, perhaps, with a certain piquancy.
      But, in their appeal to the traditional teaching of the Church, Wilson’s
      words represented the starting-point<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> from which the discussions of social
      questions still commonly set out.</p>
      <p>The Bible, the Fathers and the Schoolmen, the decretals, church
      councils, and commentators on the canon law—all these, and not only the
      first, continued to be quoted as decisive on questions of economic ethics
      by men to whom the theology and government of the medieval Church were an
      abomination. What use Wilson made of them, a glance at his book will show.
      The writer who, after him, produced the most elaborate discussion of usury
      in the latter part of the century prefaced his work with a list of
      pre-Reformation authorities running into several pages.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-36" id="noteref-3-36">36</a>] The author of a practical
      memorandum on the amendment of the law with regard to money-lending—a
      memorandum which appears to have had some effect upon policy—thought it
      necessary to drag into a paper concerned with the chicanery of financiers
      and the depreciation of sterling by speculative exchange business, not
      only Melanchthon, but Aquinas and Hostiensis.[<a href="#footnote-3-37"
      id="noteref-3-37">37</a>] Even a moralist who denied all virtue whatever
      to “the decrees of the Pope” did so only the more strongly to emphasize
      the prohibition of uncharitable dealing contained in the “statutes of
      holie Synodes and sayings of godlie Fathers, whiche vehemently forbid
      usurie.”[<a href="#footnote-3-38" id="noteref-3-38">38</a>] Objective
      economic science was developing in the hands of the experts who wrote on
      agriculture, trade, and, above all, on currency and the foreign exchanges.
      But the divines, if they read such works at all, waved them on one side as
      the intrusion of Mammon into the fold of Christian morality, and by their
      obstinate obscurantism helped to prepare an intellectual nemesis, which
      was to discredit their fervent rhetoric as the voice of a musty
      superstition. For one who examined present economic realities, ten
      rearranged thrice-quoted quotations from tomes of past economic casuistry.
      Sermon was piled upon sermon, and treatise upon treatise. The assumption
      of all is that the traditional teaching of the Church<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> as to social ethics is as binding on men’s
      consciences after the Reformation as it had been before it.</p>
      <p>Pamphlets and sermons do not deal either with sins which no one commits
      or with sins that every one commits, and the literary evidence is not to
      be dismissed merely as pious rhetoric. The literary evidence does not,
      however, stand alone. Upon the immense changes made by the Reformation in
      the political and social position of the Church it is not necessary to
      enlarge. It became, in effect, one arm of the State; excommunication, long
      discredited by abuse, was fast losing what little terrors it still
      retained; a clergy three-quarters of whom, as a result of the enormous
      transference of ecclesiastical property, were henceforward presented by
      lay patrons, were not likely to display any excessive independence. But
      the canon law was nationalized, not abolished; the assumption of most
      churchmen throughout the sixteenth century was that it was to be
      administered; and the canon law included the whole body of legislation as
      to equity in contracts which had been inherited from the Middle Ages.
      True, it was administered no longer by the clergy acting as the agents of
      Rome, but by civilians acting under the authority of the Crown. True,
      after the prohibition of the study of canon law—after the estimable Dr.
      Layton had “set Dunce in Bocardo” at Oxford—it languished at the
      universities. True, for the seven years from 1545 to 1552, and again, and
      on this occasion for good, after 1571, parliamentary legislation expressly
      sanctioned loans at interest, provided that it did not exceed a statutory
      maximum. But the convulsion which changed the source of canon law did not,
      as far as these matters are concerned, alter its scope. Its validity was
      not the less because it was now enforced in the name, not of the Pope, but
      of the King.</p>
      <p>As Maitland has pointed out,[<a href="#footnote-3-39"
      id="noteref-3-39">39</a>] there was a moment towards the middle of the
      century when the civil law was pressing the common law hard. The civil
      law, as Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span> Thomas
      Smith assured the yet briefless barrister, offered a promising career,
      since it was practiced in the ecclesiastical courts.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-40" id="noteref-3-40">40</a>] Though it did not itself
      forbid usury, it had much to say about it; it was a doctor of the civil
      law under Elizabeth by whom the most elaborate treatise on the subject was
      compiled.[<a href="#footnote-3-41" id="noteref-3-41">41</a>] By an
      argument made familiar by a modern controversy on which lay and
      ecclesiastical opinion have diverged, it is argued that the laxity of the
      State does not excuse the consciences of men who are the subjects, not
      only of the State, but of the Church. “The permission of the Prince,” it
      was urged, “is no absolution from the authority of the Church. Supposing
      usury to be unlawfull ... yet the civil laws permit it, and the Church
      forbids it. In this case the Canons are to be preferred.... By the laws no
      man is compelled to be an usurer; and therefore he must pay that reverence
      and obedience which is otherwise due to them that have the rule over them
      in the conduct of their souls.”[<a href="#footnote-3-42"
      id="noteref-3-42">42</a>]</p>
      <p>It was this theory which was held by almost all the ecclesiastical
      writers who dealt with economic ethics in the sixteenth century. Their
      view was that, in the words of a pamphleteer, “by the laws of the Church
      of England ... usury is simply and generally prohibited.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-43" id="noteref-3-43">43</a>] When the lower House of
      Convocation petitioned the bishops in 1554 for a restoration of their
      privileges, they urged, among other matters, that “usurers may be punished
      by the canon lawes as in tymes past has been used.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-44" id="noteref-3-44">44</a>] In the abortive scheme for
      the reorganization of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction drawn up by Cranmer
      and Foxe, usury was included in the list of offenses with which the
      ecclesiastical courts were to deal, and, for the guidance of judges in
      what must often have been somewhat knotty cases, a note was added,
      explaining that it was not to be taken as including the profits derived
      from objects which yielded increase by the natural process of growth.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-45" id="noteref-3-45">45</a>] Archbishop Grindal’s
      injunctions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> the
      laity of the Province of York (1571) expressly emphasized the duty of
      presenting to the Ordinary those who lend and demand back more than the
      principal, whatever the guise under which the transaction may be
      concealed.[<a href="#footnote-3-46" id="noteref-3-46">46</a>] Bishops’
      articles of visitation down to the Civil War required the presentation of
      uncharitable persons and usurers, together with drunkards, ribalds,
      swearers and sorcerers.[<a href="#footnote-3-47" id="noteref-3-47">47</a>]
      The rules to be observed in excommunicating the impenitent promulgated in
      1585, the Canons of the Province of Canterbury in 1604, and of the Irish
      Church in 1634, all included a provision that the usurer should be
      subjected to ecclesiastical discipline.[<a href="#footnote-3-48"
      id="noteref-3-48">48</a>]</p>
      <p>The activity of the ecclesiastical courts had not ceased with the
      Reformation, and they continued throughout the last half of the century to
      play an important, if increasingly unpopular, part in the machinery of
      local government. In addition to enforcing the elementary social
      obligation of charity, by punishing the man who refused to “pay to the
      poor men’s box,” or who was “detected for being an uncharitable person and
      for not giving to the poor and impotent,”[<a href="#footnote-3-49"
      id="noteref-3-49">49</a>] they dealt also, at least in theory, with those
      who offended against Christian morality by acts of extortion. The
      jurisdiction of the Church in these matters was expressly reserved by
      legislation, and ecclesiastical lawyers, while lamenting the encroachments
      of the common law courts, continued to claim certain economic misdemeanors
      as their province. That, in spite of the rising tide of opposition, the
      references to questions of this kind in articles of visitation were not
      wholly an affair of common form, is suggested by the protests against the
      interference of the clergy in matters of business, and by the occasional
      cases which show that commercial transactions continued to be brought
      before the ecclesiastical courts. The typical usurer was apt, indeed, to
      outrage not one, but all, of the decencies of social intercourse. “Thomas
      Wilkoxe,” complained his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg
      162]</span> fellow burgesses, “is excommunicated, and disquieteth the
      parish in the time of divine service. He is a horrible usurer, taking
      1<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> and sometimes 2<i><abbr
      title="pence">d.</abbr></i> for a shilling by the week. He has been cursed
      by his own father and mother. For the space of two years he hath not
      received the Holy Communion, but every Sunday, when the priest is ready to
      go to the Communion, then he departeth the church for the receiving of his
      weekly usury, and doth not tarry the end of divine service thrice in the
      year.”[<a href="#footnote-3-50" id="noteref-3-50">50</a>] Whether the
      archdeacon corrected a scandal so obviously suitable for ecclesiastical
      discipline, we do not know. But in 1578 a case of clerical usury is heard
      in the court of the archdeacon of Essex.[<a href="#footnote-3-51"
      id="noteref-3-51">51</a>] Twenty-two years later, a usurer is presented
      with other offenders on the occasion of the visitation of some Yorkshire
      parishes.[<a href="#footnote-3-52" id="noteref-3-52">52</a>] Even in 1619
      two instances occur in which money-lenders are cited before the Court of
      the Commissary of the Bishop of London, on the charge of “lending upon
      pawnes for an excessive gain commonly reported and cried out of.” One is
      excommunicated and afterwards absolved; both are admonished to amend their
      ways.[<a href="#footnote-3-53" id="noteref-3-53">53</a>]</p>
      <p>There is no reason, however, to suppose that such cases were other than
      highly exceptional; nor is it from the occasional activities of the ever
      more discredited ecclesiastical jurisdiction that light on the practical
      application of the ideas of the age as to social ethics is to be sought.
      Ecclesiastical discipline is at all times but a misleading clue to the
      influence of religious opinion, and on the practice of a time when, except
      for the Court of High Commission, the whole system was in decay, the
      scanty proceedings of the courts christian throw little light. To judge
      the degree to which the doctrines expounded by divines were accepted or
      repudiated by the common sense of the laity, one must turn to the records
      which show how questions of business ethics were handled by individuals,
      by municipal bodies and by the Government.<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>
      <p>The opinion of the practical man on questions of economic conduct was
      in the sixteenth century in a condition of even more than its customary
      confusion. A century before, he had practised extortion and been told that
      it was wrong; for it was contrary to the law of God. A century later, he
      was to practise it and be told that he was right; for it was in accordance
      with the law of nature. In this matter, as in others of even greater
      moment, the two generations which followed the Reformation were unblessed
      by these ample certitudes. They walked in an obscurity where the
      glittering armor of theologians</p>
      <div class="poetry-container">

      </div>
      <p class="continued">In practice, since new class interests and novel
      ideas had arisen, but had not yet wholly submerged those which preceded
      them, every shade of opinion, from that of the pious burgess, who
      protested indignantly against being saddled with a vicar who took a penny
      in the shilling, to the latitudinarianism of the cosmopolitan financier,
      to whom the confusion of business with morals was a vulgar delusion, was
      represented in the economic ethics of Elizabethan England.</p>
      <p>As far as the smaller property-owners were concerned, the sentiment of
      laymen differed, on the whole, less widely from the doctrines expounded by
      divines, than it did from the individualism which was beginning to carry
      all before it among the leaders of the world of business. Against the
      rising financial interests of the day were arrayed the stolid conservatism
      of the peasantry and the humbler <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, whose
      conception of social expediency was the defence of customary relations
      against innovation, and who regarded the growth of this new power with
      something of the same jealous hostility as they opposed to the economic
      radicalism of the enclosing landlord. At bottom, it was<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> an instinctive movement of
      self-protection. Free play for the capitalist seemed to menace the
      independence of the small producer, who tilled the nation’s fields and
      wove its cloth. The path down which the financier beguiles his victims may
      seem at first to be strewn with roses; but at the end of it
      lies—incredible nightmare—a <i lang="fr">régime</i> of universal
      capitalism, in which peasant and small master will have been merged in a
      propertyless proletariat, and “the riches of the city of London, and in
      effect of all this realm, shall be at that time in the hands of a few men
      having unmerciful hearts.”[<a href="#footnote-3-54"
      id="noteref-3-54">54</a>]</p>
      <p>Against the landlord who enclosed commons, converted arable to pasture,
      and rack-rented his tenants, local resentment, unless supported by the
      Government, was powerless. Against the engrosser, however, it mobilized
      the traditional machinery of maximum prices and market regulations, and
      dealt with the usurer as best it could, by presenting him before the
      justices in Quarter Sessions, by advancing money from the municipal
      exchequer to assist his victims, and even, on occasion, by establishing a
      public pawnshop, with a monopoly of the right to make loans, as a
      protection to the inhabitants against extreme “usurers and extortioners.”
      The commonest charity of the age, which was the establishment of a fund to
      make advances without interest to tradesmen, was inspired by similar
      motives. Its aim was to enable the young artisan or shopkeeper, the
      favorite victim of the money-lender, to acquire the indispensable “stock,”
      without which he could not set up in business.[<a href="#footnote-3-55"
      id="noteref-3-55">55</a>]</p>
      <p>The issues which confronted the Government were naturally more
      complicated, and its attitude was more ambiguous. The pressure of
      commercial interests growing in wealth and influence, its own clamorous
      financial necessities, the mere logic of economic development, made it out
      of the question for it to contemplate, even if it had been disposed<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span> to do so, the rigorous
      economic discipline desired by the divines. Tradition, a natural
      conservatism, the apprehension of public disorder caused by enclosures or
      by distress among the industrial population, a belief in its own mission
      as the guardian of “good order” in trade, not unmingled with a hope that
      the control of economic affairs might be made to yield agreeable financial
      pickings, gave it a natural bias to a policy which aimed at drawing all
      the threads of economic life into the hands of a paternal monarchy.</p>
      <p>In the form which the system assumed under Elizabeth, considerations of
      public policy, which appealed to the State, were hardly distinguishable
      from considerations of social morality, which appealed to the Church. As a
      result of the Reformation the relations previously existing between the
      Church and the State had been almost exactly reversed. In the Middle Ages
      the former had been, at least in theory, the ultimate authority on
      questions of public and private morality, while the latter was the
      police-officer which enforced its decrees. In the sixteenth century, the
      Church became the ecclesiastical department of the State, and religion was
      used to lend a moral sanction to secular social policy. But the religious
      revolution had not destroyed the conception of a single society, of which
      Church and State were different aspects; and, when the canon law became
      “the King’s ecclesiastical law of England,” the jurisdiction of both
      inevitably tended to merge. Absorbing the ecclesiastical authority into
      itself, the Crown had its own reasons of political expediency for
      endeavoring to maintain traditional standards of social conduct, as an
      antidote for what Cecil called “the license grown by liberty of the
      Gospel.” Ecclesiastics, in their turn, were public officers—under
      Elizabeth the bishop was normally also a justice of the peace—and relied
      on secular machinery to enforce, not only religious conformity, but
      Christian morality, because both were elements<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span> in a society in which secular and spiritual
      interests had not yet been completely disentangled from each other. “We
      mean by the Commonwealth,” wrote Hooker, “that society with relation unto
      all public affairs thereof, only the matter of true religion accepted; by
      the Church, the same society, with only reference unto the matter of true
      religion, without any other affairs besides.”[<a href="#footnote-3-56"
      id="noteref-3-56">56</a>]</p>
      <p>In economic and social, as in ecclesiastical, matters, the opening
      years of Elizabeth were a period of conservative reconstruction. The
      psychology of a nation which lives predominantly by the land is in sharp
      contrast with that of a commercial society. In the latter, when all goes
      well, continuous expansion is taken for granted as the rule of life, new
      horizons are constantly opening, and the catchword of politics is the
      encouragement of enterprise. In the former, the number of niches into
      which each successive generation must be fitted is strictly limited;
      movement means disturbance, for, as one man rises, another is thrust down;
      and the object of statesmen is, not to foster individual initiative, but
      to prevent social dislocation. It was in this mood that Tudor Privy
      Councils approached questions of social policy and industrial
      organization. Except when they were diverted by financial interests, or
      lured into ambitious, and usually unsuccessful, projects for promoting
      economic development, their ideal was, not progress, but stability. Their
      enemies were disorder, and the restless appetites which, since they led to
      the encroachment of class on class, were thought to provoke it.
      Distrusting economic individualism for reasons of state as heartily as did
      churchmen for reasons of religion, their aim was to crystallize existing
      class relationships by submitting them to the pressure, at once
      restrictive and protective, of a paternal Government, vigilant to detect
      all movements which menaced the established order, and alert to suppress
      them.</p>

      <p>The practical application of such conceptions was an elaborate system
      of what might be called, to use a modern analogy, “controls.” Wages, the
      movement of labor, the entry into a trade, dealings in grain and in wool,
      methods of cultivation, methods of manufacture, foreign exchange business,
      rates of interest—all are controlled, partly by Statute, but still more by
      the administrative activity of the Council. In theory, nothing is too
      small or too great to escape the eyes of an omniscient State. Does a
      landowner take advantage of the ignorance of peasants and the uncertainty
      of the law to enclose commons or evict copyholders? The Council, while
      protesting that it does not intend to hinder him from asserting his rights
      at common law, will intervene to stop gross cases of oppression, to
      prevent poor men from being made the victims of legal chicanery and
      intimidation, to settle disputes by common sense and moral pressure, to
      remind the aggressor that he is bound “rather to consider what is
      agreeable ... to the use of this State and for the good of the comon
      wealthe, than to seeke the uttermost advantage that a landlord for his
      particular profit maie take amonge his tenaunts.”[<a href="#footnote-3-57"
      id="noteref-3-57">57</a>] Have prices been raised by a bad harvest? The
      Council will issue a solemn denunciation<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span> of the covetousness of speculators, “in
      conditions more like to wolves or cormorants than to natural men,”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-58" id="noteref-3-58">58</a>] who take advantage of the
      dearth to exploit public necessities; will instruct the Commissioners of
      Grain and Victuals to suspend exports; and will order justices to inspect
      barns, ration supplies, and compel farmers to sell surplus stocks at a
      fixed price. Does the collapse of the continental market threaten distress
      in the textile districts? The Council will put pressure on clothiers to
      find work for the operatives, “this being the rule by which the
      wool-grower, the clothier and merchant must be governed, that whosoever
      had a part of the gaine in profitable times ... must now, in the decay of
      trade ... beare a part of the publicke losses, as may best conduce to the
      good of the publicke and the maintenance of the generall trade.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-59" id="noteref-3-59">59</a>] Has the value of sterling
      fallen on the Antwerp market? The Council will consider pegging the
      exchanges, and will even attempt to nationalize foreign exchange business
      by prohibiting private transactions altogether.[<a href="#footnote-3-60"
      id="noteref-3-60">60</a>] Are local authorities negligent in the
      administration of the Poor Law? The Council, which insists on regular
      reports as to the punishment of vagrants, the relief of the impotent, and
      the steps taken to provide materials on which to employ the able-bodied,
      inundates them with exhortations to mend their ways and with threats of
      severer proceedings if they fail. Are tradesmen in difficulties? The
      Council, which keeps sufficiently in touch with business conditions to
      know when the difficulties of borrowers threaten a crisis, endeavors to
      exercise a moderating influence by making an example of persons guilty of
      flagrant extortion, or by inducing the parties to accept a compromise. A
      mortgagee accused of “hard and unchristianly dealing” is ordered to
      restore the land which he has seized, or to appear before the Council. A
      creditor who has been similarly “hard and unconscionable” is committed to
      the Fleet. The justices of Norfolk are instructed<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span> to put pressure on a money-lender who has
      taken “very unjust and immoderate advantage by way of usury.” The bishop
      of Exeter is urged to induce a usurer in his diocese to show “a more
      Christian and charitable consideration of these his neighbors.” A nobleman
      has released two offenders imprisoned by the High Commission for the
      Province of York for having “taken usury contrary to the laws of God and
      of the realm,” and is ordered at once to recommit them. No Government can
      face with equanimity a state of things in which large numbers of
      respectable tradesmen may be plunged into bankruptcy. In times of unusual
      depression, the Council’s intervention to prevent creditors from pressing
      their claims to the hilt was so frequent as to create the impression of
      something like an informal moratorium.[<a href="#footnote-3-61"
      id="noteref-3-61">61</a>]</p>
      <p>The Governments of the Tudors and, still more, of the first two
      Stuarts, were masters of the art of disguising commonplace, and sometimes
      sordid, motives beneath a glittering façade of imposing principles. In
      spite of its lofty declarations of a disinterested solicitude for the
      public welfare, the social policy of the monarchy not only was as slipshod
      in execution as it was grandiose in design, but was not seldom perverted
      into measures disastrous to its ostensible ends, both by the sinister
      pressure of sectional interests, and by the insistent necessities of an
      empty exchequer. Its fundamental conception, however—the philosophy of the
      thinkers and of the few statesmen who rose above immediate exigencies to
      consider the significance of the system in its totality—had a natural
      affinity with the doctrines which commended themselves to men of religion.
      It was of an ordered and graded society, in which each class performed its
      allotted function, and was secured such a livelihood, and no more than
      such a livelihood, as was proportioned to its status. “God and the Kinge,”
      wrote one who had labored much, amid grave personal dangers, for the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> welfare of his fellows,
      “hathe not sent us the poore lyvinge we have, but to doe services therfore
      amonge our neighbours abroade.”[<a href="#footnote-3-62"
      id="noteref-3-62">62</a>] The divines who fulminated against the
      uncharitable covetousness of the extortionate middleman, the grasping
      money-lender, or the tyrannous landlord, saw in the measures by which the
      Government endeavored to suppress the greed of individuals or the
      collision of classes a much needed cement of social solidarity, and
      appealed to Cæsar to redouble his penalties upon an economic license which
      was hateful to God. The statesmen concerned to prevent agitation saw in
      religion the preservative of order, and the antidote for the cupidity or
      ambition which threatened to destroy it, and reënforced the threat of
      temporal penalties with arguments that would not have been out of place in
      the pulpit. To both alike religion is concerned with something more than
      personal salvation. It is the sanction of social duties and the spiritual
      manifestation of the corporate life of a complex, yet united, society. To
      both the State is something more than an institution created by material
      necessities or political convenience. It is the temporal expression of
      spiritual obligations. It is a link between the individual soul and that
      supernatural society of which all Christian men are held to be members. It
      rests not merely on practical convenience, but on the will of God.</p>
      <p>Of that philosophy, the classical expression, at once the most
      catholic, the most reasonable and the most sublime, is the work of Hooker.
      What it meant to one cast in a narrower mould, pedantic, irritable and
      intolerant, yet not without the streak of harsh nobility which belongs to
      all who love an idea, however unwisely, more than their own ease, is
      revealed in the sermons and the activity of Laud. Laud’s intellectual
      limitations and practical blunders need no emphasis. If his vices made him
      intolerable to the most powerful forces of his own age, his virtues were
      not of a kind to commend him to those of its successor, and history<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span> has been hardly more
      merciful to him than were his political opponents. But an intense
      conviction of the fundamental solidarity of all the manifold elements in a
      great community, a grand sense of the dignity of public duties, a
      passionate hatred for the self-seeking pettiness of personal cupidities
      and sectional interests—these qualities are not among the weaknesses
      against which the human nature of ordinary men requires to be most upon
      its guard, and these qualities Laud possessed, not only in abundance, but
      to excess. His worship of unity was an idolatry, his detestation of
      faction a superstition. Church and State are one Jerusalem: “Both
      Commonwealth and Church are collective bodies, made up of many into one;
      and both so near allied that the one, the Church, can never subsist but in
      the other, the Commonwealth; nay, so near, that the same men, which in a
      temporal respect make the Commonwealth, do in a spiritual make the
      Church.”[<a href="#footnote-3-63" id="noteref-3-63">63</a>] Private and
      public interests are inextricably interwoven. The sanction of unity is
      religion. The foundation of unity is justice: “God will not bless the
      State, if kings and magistrates do not execute judgment, if the widow and
      the fatherless have cause to cry out against the ‘thrones of justice.’”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-64" id="noteref-3-64">64</a>]</p>
      <p>To a temper so permeated with the conception that society is an
      organism compact of diverse parts, and that the grand end of government is
      to maintain their coöperation, every social movement or personal motive
      which sets group against group, or individual against individual, appears,
      not the irrepressible energy of life, but the mutterings of chaos. The
      first demon to be exorcised is party, for Governments must “entertain no
      private business,” and “parties are ever private ends.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-65" id="noteref-3-65">65</a>] The second is the
      self-interest which leads the individual to struggle for riches and
      advancement. “There is no private end, but in something or other it will
      be led to run cross the public; and, if gain come in, though it be by
      ‘making shrines for Diana,’ it is no matter with them<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span> though Ephesus be in an uproar for it.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-66" id="noteref-3-66">66</a>] For Laud, the political
      virtues, by which he understands subordination, obedience, a willingness
      to sacrifice personal interests for the good of the community, are as much
      part of the Christian’s religion as are the duties of private life; and,
      unlike some of those who sigh for social unity today, he is as ready to
      chastise the rich and powerful, who thwart the attainment of that ideal,
      as he is to preach it to the humble. To talk of holiness and to practice
      injustice is mere hypocrisy. Man is born a member of a society and is
      dedicated by religion to the service of his fellows. To repudiate the
      obligation is to be guilty of a kind of political atheism.</p>
      <p>“If any man be so addicted to his private, that he neglect the common,
      state, he is void of the sense of piety and wisheth peace and happiness to
      himself in vain. For whoever he be, he must live in the body of the
      Commonwealth, and in the body of the Church.”[<a href="#footnote-3-67"
      id="noteref-3-67">67</a>] To one holding such a creed economic
      individualism was hardly less abhorrent than religious nonconformity, and
      its repression was a not less obvious duty; for both seemed incompatible
      with the stability of a society in which Commonwealth and Church were one.
      It is natural, therefore, that Laud’s utterances and activities in the
      matter of social policy should have shown a strong bias in favor of the
      control of economic relations by an authoritarian State, which reached its
      climax in the eleven years of personal government. It was a moment when,
      partly in continuance of the traditional policy of protecting peasants and
      maintaining the supply of grain, partly for less reputable reasons of
      finance, the Government was more than usually active in harrying the
      depopulating landlord. The Council gave sympathetic consideration to
      petitions from peasants begging for protection or redress, and in 1630
      directions were issued to the justices of five midland counties to remove
      all enclosures made in the last five years, on the ground that they
      resulted in depopulation and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg
      173]</span> particularly harmful in times of dearth. In 1632, 1635, and
      1636, three Commissions were appointed and special instructions against
      enclosure were issued to the Justices of Assize. In parts of the country,
      at any rate, land which had been laid down to grass was plowed up in
      obedience to the Government’s orders. In the four years from 1635 to 1638
      a list of some 600 offenders was returned to the Council, and about
      £50,000 was imposed upon them in fines.[<a href="#footnote-3-68"
      id="noteref-3-68">68</a>] With this policy Laud was whole-heartedly in
      sympathy. A letter in his private correspondence, in which he expresses
      his detestation of enclosure, reveals the temper which evoked Clarendon’s
      gentle complaint that the archbishop made himself unpopular by his
      inclination “a little too much to countenance the Commission for
      Depopulation.”[<a href="#footnote-3-69" id="noteref-3-69">69</a>] Laud was
      himself an active member of the Commission, and dismissed with impatient
      contempt the squirearchy’s appeal to the common law. In the day of his
      ruin he was reminded by his enemies of the needlessly sharp censures with
      which he barbed the fine imposed upon an enclosing landlord.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-70" id="noteref-3-70">70</a>]</p>
      <p>The prevention of enclosure and depopulation was merely one element in
      a general policy, by which a benevolent Government, unhampered by what
      Laud had called “that noise” of parliamentary debate, was to endeavor by
      even-handed pressure to enforce social obligations on great and small, and
      to prevent the public interest being sacrificed to an unconscionable
      appetite for private gain. The preoccupation of the Council with the
      problem of securing adequate food supplies and reasonable prices, with
      poor relief, and, to a lesser degree, with questions of wages, has been
      described by Miss Leonard, and its attempts to protect craftsmen against
      exploitation at the hands of merchants by Professor Unwin.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-71" id="noteref-3-71">71</a>] In 1630-1 it issued in an
      amended form the Elizabethan Book of Orders, instructing justices as to
      their duty to see that markets were served and prices controlled,
      appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> a special
      committee of the Privy Council as Commissioners of the Poor and later a
      separate Commission, and issued a Book of Orders for the better
      administration of the Poor Law. In 1629, 1631, and again in 1637, it took
      steps to secure that the wages of textile workers in East Anglia were
      raised, and punished with imprisonment in the Fleet an employer notorious
      for paying in truck. As President of the Council of the North, Wentworth
      protected the commoners whose vested interests were threatened by the
      drainage of Hatfield Chase, and endeavored to insist on the stricter
      administration of the code regulating the woollen industry.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-72" id="noteref-3-72">72</a>]</p>
      <p>Such action, even if inspired largely by the obvious interest of the
      Government, which had enemies enough on its hands already, in preventing
      popular discontent, was of a kind to appeal to one with Laud’s
      indifference to the opinion of the wealthier classes, and with Laud’s
      belief in the divine mission of the House of David to teach an obedient
      people “to lay down the private for the public sake.” It is not
      surprising, therefore, when the Star Chamber fines an engrosser of corn,
      to find him improving the occasion with the remark that the defendant has
      been “guilty of a most foule offence, which the Prophet hath [called] in a
      very energeticall phrase grynding the faces of the poore,” and that the
      dearth has been caused, not by God, but by “cruell men”;[<a
      href="#footnote-3-73" id="noteref-3-73">73</a>] or taking part in the
      proceedings of the Privy Council at a time when it is pressing justices,
      apparently not without success, to compel the East Anglian clothiers to
      raise the wages of spinners and weavers; or serving on the Lincolnshire
      sub-committee of the Commission on the Relief of the Poor, which was
      appointed in January 1631.[<a href="#footnote-3-74"
      id="noteref-3-74">74</a>]</p>
      <p>“A bishop,” observed Laud, in answer to the attack of Lord Saye and
      Sele, “may preach the Gospel more publicly and to far greater edification
      in a court of judicature, or at a Council-table, where great men are met
      together to draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span> things
      to an issue, than many preachers in their several charges can.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-75" id="noteref-3-75">75</a>] The Church, which had
      abandoned the pretension itself to control society, found some
      compensation in the reflection that its doctrines were not wholly without
      influence in impressing the principles which were applied by the State.
      The history of the rise of individual liberty—to use a question-begging
      phrase—in economic affairs follows somewhat the same course as does its
      growth in the more important sphere of religion, and is not unconnected
      with it. The conception of religion as a thing private and individual does
      not emerge until after a century in which religious freedom normally means
      the freedom of the State to prescribe religion, not the freedom of the
      individual to worship God as he pleases. The assertion of economic liberty
      as a natural right comes at the close of a period in which, while a
      religious phraseology was retained and a religious interpretation of
      social institutions was often sincerely held, the supernatural sanction
      had been increasingly merged in doctrines based on reasons of state and
      public expediency. “Jerusalem ... stands not for the City and the State
      only ... nor for the Temple and the Church only, but jointly for both.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-76" id="noteref-3-76">76</a>] In identifying the
      maintenance of public morality with the spasmodic activities of an
      incompetent Government, the Church had built its house upon the sand. It
      did not require prophetic gifts to foresee that the fall of the City would
      be followed by the destruction of the Temple.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-3-3"><abbr title="3">III</abbr>. THE GROWTH OF
      INDIVIDUALISM</h3>
      <p>Though the assertion of the traditional economic ethics continued to be
      made by one school of churchmen down to the meeting of the Long
      Parliament, it was increasingly the voice of the past appealing to an
      alien generation. The expression of a theory of society which had made
      religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> supreme over
      all secular affairs, it had outlived the synthesis in which it had been an
      element, and survived, an archaic fragment, into an age to whose
      increasing individualism the idea of corporate morality was as
      objectionable as that of ecclesiastical discipline by bishops and
      archdeacons was becoming to its religion. The collision between the
      prevalent practice, and what still purported to be the teaching of the
      Church, is almost the commonest theme of the economic literature of the
      period from 1550 to 1640; of much of it, indeed, it is the occasion.
      Whatever the Church might say, men had asked interest for loans, and
      charged what prices the market would stand, at the very zenith of the Age
      of Faith. But then, except in the great commercial centers and in the high
      finance of the Papacy and of secular Governments, their transactions had
      been petty and individual, an occasional shift to meet an emergency or
      seize an opportunity. The new thing in the England of the sixteenth
      century was that devices that had formerly been occasional were now woven
      into the very texture of the industrial and commercial civilization which
      was developing in the later years of Elizabeth, and whose subsequent
      enormous expansion was to give English society its characteristic quality
      and tone. Fifty years later, Harrington, in a famous passage, described
      how the ruin of the feudal nobility by the Tudors, by democratizing the
      ownership of land, had prepared the way for the <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i>
      republic.[<a href="#footnote-3-77" id="noteref-3-77">77</a>] His hint of
      the economic changes which preceded the Civil War might be given a wider
      application. The age of Elizabeth saw a steady growth of capitalism in
      textiles and mining, a great increase of foreign trade and an outburst of
      joint-stock enterprise in connection with it, the beginnings of something
      like deposit banking in the hands of the scriveners, and the growth, aided
      by the fall of Antwerp and the Government’s own financial necessities, of
      a money-market with an almost modern technique—speculation, futures and
      arbitrage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
      transactions—in London. The future lay with the classes who sprang to
      wealth and influence with the expansion of commerce in the later years of
      the century, and whose religious and political aspirations were, two
      generations later, to overthrow the monarchy.</p>
      <p>An organized money-market has many advantages. But it is not a school
      of social ethics or of political responsibility. Finance, being
      essentially impersonal, a matter of opportunities, security and risks,
      acted among other causes as a solvent of the sentiment, fostered both by
      the teaching of the Church and the decencies of social intercourse among
      neighbors, which regarded keen bargaining as “sharp practice.” In the
      half-century which followed the Reformation, thanks to the collapse of
      sterling on the international market, as a result of a depreciated
      currency, war, and a foreign debt contracted on ruinous terms, the state
      of the foreign exchanges was the obsession of publicists and politicians.
      Problems of currency and credit lend themselves more readily than most
      economic questions to discussion in terms of mechanical causation. It was
      in the long debate provoked by the rise in prices and the condition of the
      exchanges, that the psychological assumptions, which were afterwards to be
      treated by economists as of self-evident and universal validity, were
      first hammered out.</p>
      <p>“We see,” wrote Malynes, “how one thing driveth or enforceth another,
      like as in a clock where there are many wheels, the first wheel being
      stirred driveth the next and that the third and so forth, till the last
      that moveth the instrument that striketh the clock; or like as in a press
      going in a strait, where the foremost is driven by him that is next to
      him, and the next by him that followeth him.”[<a href="#footnote-3-78"
      id="noteref-3-78">78</a>] The spirit of modern business could hardly be
      more aptly described. Conservative writers denounced it as fostering a
      soulless individualism, but, needless to say, their denunciations were as
      futile as they were justified. It might be<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span> possible to put fear into the heart of the
      village dealer who bought cheap and sold dear, or of the pawnbroker who
      took a hundred quarters of wheat when he had lent ninety, with the warning
      that “the devices of men cannot be concealed from Almighty God.” To a
      great clothier, or to a capitalist like Pallavicino, Spinola, or Thomas
      Gresham, who managed the Government business in Antwerp, such sentiments
      were foolishness, and usurious interest appeared, not bad morals, but bad
      business. Moving, as they did, in a world where loans were made, not to
      meet the temporary difficulty of an unfortunate neighbor, but as a
      profitable investment on the part of not too scrupulous business men, who
      looked after themselves and expected others to do the same, they had
      scanty sympathy with doctrines which reflected the spirit of mutual aid
      not unnatural in the small circle of neighbors who formed the ordinary
      village or borough in rural England.</p>
      <p>It was a natural result of their experience that, without the formal
      enunciation of any theory of economic individualism, they should throw
      their weight against the traditional restrictions, resent the attempts
      made by preachers and popular movements to apply doctrines of charity and
      “good conscience” to the impersonal mechanism of large-scale transactions,
      and seek to bring public policy more into accordance with their economic
      practice. The opposition to the Statutes against depopulation offered by
      the self-interest of the gentry was being supported in the latter years of
      Elizabeth by free-trade arguments in the House of Commons, and the last
      Act, which was passed in 1597, expressly allowed land to be laid down to
      pasture for the purpose of giving it a rest.[<a href="#footnote-3-79"
      id="noteref-3-79">79</a>] From at any rate the middle of the century, the
      fixing of prices by municipal authorities and by the Government was
      regarded with skepticism by the more advanced economic theorists, and
      towards the end of the century it produced complaints that, since it<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span> weakened the farmer’s
      incentive to grow corn, its results were the precise opposite of those
      intended.[<a href="#footnote-3-80" id="noteref-3-80">80</a>] As markets
      widened, the control of the middleman who dealt in wool and grain, though
      strictly enforced in theory, showed unmistakable signs of breaking down in
      practice. Gresham attacked the prohibition of usury, and normally
      stipulated that financiers who subscribed on his inducement to public
      loans should be indemnified against legal proceedings.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-81" id="noteref-3-81">81</a>] Nor could he well have
      done otherwise, for the sentiment of the City was that of the merchant in
      Wilson’s Dialogue: “What man is so madde to deliver his moneye out of his
      owne possession for naughte? or whoe is he that will not make of his owne
      the best he can?”[<a href="#footnote-3-82" id="noteref-3-82">82</a>] With
      such a wind of doctrine in their sails men were not far from the days of
      complete freedom of contract.</p>
      <p>Most significant of all, economic interests were already appealing to
      the political theory which, when finally systematized by Locke, was to
      prove that the State which interferes with property and business destroys
      its own title to exist. “All free subjects,” declared a Committee of the
      House of Commons in 1604, “are born inheritable, as to their land, so also
      to the free exercise of their industry, in those trades whereto they apply
      themselves and whereby they are to live. Merchandise being the chief and
      richest of all other, and of greater extent and importance than all the
      rest, it is against the natural right and liberty of the subjects of
      England to restrain it into the hands of some few.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-83" id="noteref-3-83">83</a>] The process by which
      natural justice, imperfectly embodied in positive law, was replaced as the
      source of authority by positive law which might or might not be the
      expression of natural justice, had its analogy in the rejection by social
      theory of the whole conception of an objective standard of economic
      equity. The law of nature had been invoked by medieval writers as a moral
      restraint upon economic self-interest. By the seventeenth century, a
      significant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span> revolution
      had taken place. “Nature” had come to connote, not divine ordinance, but
      human appetites, and natural rights were invoked by the individualism of
      the age as a reason why self-interest should be given free play.</p>
      <p>The effect of these practical exigencies and intellectual changes was
      seen in a reversal of policy on the part of the State. In 1571 the Act of
      1552, which had prohibited all interest as “a vyce moste odyous and
      detestable, as in dyvers places of the hollie Scripture it is evydent to
      be seen,” had been repealed, after a debate in the House which revealed
      the revolt of the plain man against the theorists who had triumphed twenty
      years before, and his determination that the law should not impose on
      business a utopian morality.[<a href="#footnote-3-84"
      id="noteref-3-84">84</a>] The exaction of interest ceased to be a criminal
      offence, provided that the rate did not exceed ten per cent., though it
      still remained open to a debtor, in the improbable event of his thinking
      it expedient to jeopardize his chance of future advances, to take civil
      proceedings to recover any payment made in excess of the principal. This
      qualified condonation of usury on the part of the State naturally reacted
      upon religious opinion. The Crown was supreme ruler of the Church of
      Christ, and it was not easy for a loyal Church to be more fastidious than
      its head. Moderate interest, if without legal protection, was at any rate
      not unlawful, and it is difficult to damn with conviction vices of which
      the degrees have been adjusted on a sliding scale by an Act of Parliament.
      Objective economic science was beginning its disillusioning career, in the
      form of discussions on the rise in prices, the mechanism of the
      money-market, and the balance of trade, by publicists concerned, not to
      point a moral, but to analyze forces so productive of profit to those
      interested in their operation. Since Calvin’s indulgence to interest,
      critics of the traditional doctrine could argue that religion itself spoke
      with an uncertain voice.</p>
      <p>Such developments inevitably affected the tone in which<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> the discussion of economic
      ethics was carried on by the divines, and even before the end of the
      sixteenth century, though they did not dream of abandoning the
      denunciation of unconscionable bargains, they were surrounding it with
      qualifications. The <i>Decades</i> of Bullinger, of which three English
      translations were made in the ten years following his death, and which
      Convocation in 1586 required to be obtained and studied by all the
      inferior clergy, indicated a <i lang="la">via media</i>. As uncompromising
      as any medieval writer in his hatred of the sin of covetousness, he
      denounces with all the old fervor oppressive contracts which grind the
      poor. But he is less intolerant of economic motives than most of his
      predecessors, and concedes, with Calvin, that, before interest is
      condemned as usury, it is necessary to consider both the terms of the loan
      and the position of borrower and lender.</p>
      <p>The stricter school of religious opinion continued to cling to the
      traditional theory down to the Civil War. Conservative divines took
      advantage of the section in the Act of 1571 declaring that “all usurie
      being forbydden by the lawe of God is synne and detestable,” to argue that
      the Statute had in reality altered nothing, and that the State left it to
      the Church to prevent bargains which, for reasons of practical expediency,
      it did not think fit to prohibit, but which it did not encourage and
      declined to enforce. It is in obedience to such doctrines that a
      scrupulous parson refuses a cure until he is assured that the money which
      will be paid to him comes from the rent of land, not from interest on
      capital.[<a href="#footnote-3-85" id="noteref-3-85">85</a>] But, even so,
      there are difficulties. The parson of Kingham bequeaths a cow to the poor
      of Burford, which is “set to hire for a year or two for four shillings a
      year,” the money being used for their assistance. But the arrangement has
      its inconveniences. Cows are mortal, and this communal cow is “very like
      to have perished through casualty and ill-keeping.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-86" id="noteref-3-86">86</a>] Will not the poor be surer
      of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
      their money if the cow is disposed of for cash down? So it is sold to the
      man who previously hired it, and the interest spent on the poor instead.
      Is this usury? Is it usury to invest money in business in order to provide
      an income for those, like widows and orphans, who cannot trade with it
      themselves? If it is lawful to buy a rent-charge or to share in trading
      profits, what is the particular criminality of charging a price for a
      loan? Why should a creditor, who may himself be poor, make a loan <i
      lang="fr">gratis</i>, in order to put money into the pocket of a wealthy
      capitalist, who uses the advance to corner the wool crop or to speculate
      on the exchanges?</p>
      <p>To such questions liberal theologians answered that the crucial point
      was not the letter of the law which forbad the breeding of barren metal,
      but the observance of Christian charity in economic, as in other,
      transactions. Their opponents appealed to the text of Scripture and the
      law of the Church, argued that usury differed, not merely in degree, but
      in kind, from payments which, like rent and profits, were morally
      unobjectionable provided that they were not extortionate in amount, and
      insisted that usury was to be interpreted as “whatever is taken for a loan
      above the principal.” The literature of the subject was voluminous. But it
      was obsolete almost before it was produced. For, whether theologians and
      moralists condemned all interest, or only some interest, as contrary to
      Christian ethics, the assumption implied in their very disagreement had
      been that economic relations belonged to a province of which, in the last
      resort, the Church was master. That economic transactions were one
      department of ethical conduct, and to be judged, like other parts of it,
      by spiritual criteria; that, whatever concessions the State might see fit
      to make to human frailty, a certain standard of economic morality was
      involved in membership of the Christian Church; that it was the function
      of ecclesiastical authorities, whoever they might<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span> be, to take the action needed to bring home
      to men their social obligations—such doctrines were still common ground to
      all sections of religious thought. It was precisely this whole conception
      of a social theory based ultimately on religion which was being
      discredited. While rival authorities were discussing the correct
      interpretation of economic ethics, the flank of both was turned by the
      growth of a powerful body of lay opinion, which argued that economics were
      one thing and ethics another.</p>
      <p>Usury, a summary name for all kinds of extortion, was the issue in
      which the whole controversy over “good conscience” in bargaining came to a
      head, and such questions were only one illustration of the immense
      problems with which the rise of a commercial civilization confronted a
      Church whose social ethics still professed to be those of the Bible, the
      Fathers and the Schoolmen. A score of books, garnished with citations from
      Scripture and from the canonists, were written to answer them. Many of
      them are learned; some are almost readable. But it may be doubted whether,
      even in their own day, they satisfied any one but their authors. The truth
      is that, in spite of the sincerity with which it was held that the
      transactions of business must somehow be amenable to the moral law, the
      code of practical ethics, in which that claim was expressed, had been
      forged to meet the conditions of a very different environment from that of
      commercial England in the seventeenth century.</p>
      <p>The most crucial and the most difficult of all political questions is
      that which turns on the difference between public and private morality.
      The problem which it presents in the relations between States is a
      commonplace. But, since its essence is the difficulty of applying the same
      moral standard to decisions which affect large masses of men as to those
      in which only individuals are involved, it emerges in a hardly less acute
      form in the sphere of economic life, as<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span> soon as its connections ramify widely, and
      the unit is no longer the solitary producer, but a group. To argue, in the
      manner of Machiavelli, that there is one rule for business and another for
      private life, is to open a door to an orgy of unscrupulousness before
      which the mind recoils. To argue that there is no difference at all is to
      lay down a principle which few men who have faced the difficulty in
      practice will be prepared to endorse as of invariable application, and
      incidentally to expose the idea of morality itself to discredit by
      subjecting it to an almost intolerable strain. The practical result of
      sentimentality is too often a violent reaction towards the baser kinds of
      <i lang="de">Realpolitik</i>.</p>
      <p>With the expansion of finance and international trade in the sixteenth
      century, it was this problem which faced the Church. Granted that I should
      love my neighbor as myself, the questions which, under modern conditions
      of large-scale organization, remain for solution are, Who precisely
      <i>is</i> my neighbor? and, How exactly am I to make my love for him
      effective in practice? To these questions the conventional religious
      teaching supplied no answer, for it had not even realized that they could
      be put. It had tried to moralize economic relations by treating every
      transaction as a case of personal conduct, involving personal
      responsibility. In an age of impersonal finance, world-markets and a
      capitalist organization of industry, its traditional social doctrines had
      no specific to offer, and were merely repeated, when, in order to be
      effective, they should have been thought out again from the beginning and
      formulated in new and living terms. It had endeavored to protect the
      peasant and the craftsman against the oppression of the money-lender and
      the monopolist. Faced with the problems of a wage-earning proletariat, it
      could do no more than repeat, with meaningless iteration, its traditional
      lore as to the duties of master to servant and servant to master. It had
      insisted that all men were brethren. But it did not occur to it to<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> point out that, as a result
      of the new economic imperialism which was beginning to develop in the
      seventeenth century, the brethren of the English merchant were the
      Africans whom he kidnaped for slavery in America, or the American Indians
      whom he stripped of their lands, or the Indian craftsmen from whom he
      bought muslins and silks at starvation prices. Religion had not yet
      learned to console itself for the practical difficulty of applying its
      moral principles by clasping the comfortable formula that for the
      transactions of economic life no moral principles exist. But, for the
      problems involved in the association of men for economic purposes on the
      grand scale which was to be increasingly the rule in the future, the
      social doctrines advanced from the pulpit offered, in their traditional
      form, little guidance. Their practical ineffectiveness prepared the way
      for their theoretical abandonment.</p>
      <p>They were abandoned because, on the whole, they deserved to be
      abandoned. The social teaching of the Church had ceased to count, because
      the Church itself had ceased to think. Energy in economic action, realist
      intelligence in economic thought—these qualities were to be the note of
      the seventeenth century, when once the confusion of the Civil War had died
      down. When mankind is faced with the choice between exhilarating
      activities and piety imprisoned in a shriveled mass of desiccated formulæ,
      it will choose the former, though the energy be brutal and the
      intelligence narrow. In the age of Bacon and Descartes, bursting with
      clamorous interests and eager ideas, fruitful, above all, in the germs of
      economic speculation, from which was to grow the new science of Political
      Arithmetic, the social theory of the Church of England turned its face
      from the practical world, to pore over doctrines which, had their original
      authors been as impervious to realities as their later exponents, would
      never have been formulated. Naturally<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> it was shouldered aside. It was neglected
      because it had become negligible.</p>
      <p>The defect was fundamental. It made itself felt in countries where
      there was no Reformation, no Puritan movement, no common law jealous of
      its rights and eager to prune ecclesiastical pretensions. But in England
      there were all three, and, from the beginning of the last quarter of the
      sixteenth century, ecclesiastical authorities who attempted to enforce
      traditional morality had to reckon with a temper which denied their right
      to exercise any jurisdiction at all, above all, any jurisdiction
      interfering with economic matters. It was not merely that there was the
      familiar objection of the plain man that parsons know nothing of
      business—that “it is not in simple divines to show what contract is lawful
      and what is not.”[<a href="#footnote-3-87" id="noteref-3-87">87</a>] More
      important, there was the opposition of the common lawyers to part, at
      least, of the machinery of ecclesiastical discipline. Bancroft in 1605
      complained to the Privy Council that the judges were endeavoring to
      confine the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to testamentary and
      matrimonial cases, and alleged that, of more than five hundred
      prohibitions issued to stop proceedings in the Court of Arches since the
      accession of Elizabeth, not more than one in twenty could be sustained.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-88" id="noteref-3-88">88</a>] “As things are,” wrote two
      years later the author of a treatise on the civil and ecclesiastical law,
      “neither jurisdiction knowes their owne bounds, but one snatcheth from the
      other, in maner as in a batable ground lying betweene two kingdomes.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-89" id="noteref-3-89">89</a>] The jurisdiction of the
      Court of High Commission suffered in the same way. In the last resort
      appeals from the ecclesiastical courts went either to it or to the Court
      of Delegates. From the latter part of the sixteenth century down to the
      removal of Coke from the Bench in 1616, the judges were from time to time
      staying proceedings before the Court of High Commission by prohibitions,
      or discharging offenders imprisoned by it. In 1577, for example, they<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span> released on a writ of <i
      lang="la">Habeas Corpus</i> a prisoner committed by the High Commission on
      a charge of usury.[<a href="#footnote-3-90" id="noteref-3-90">90</a>]</p>
      <p>Most fundamental of all, there was the growth of a theory of the
      Church, which denied the very principle of a discipline exercised by
      bishops and archdeacons. The acquiescence of the laity in the moral
      jurisdiction of the clergy had been accorded with less and less readiness
      for two centuries before the Reformation. With the growth under Elizabeth
      of a vigorous Puritan movement, which had its stronghold among the trading
      and commercial classes, that jurisdiction became to a considerable
      proportion of the population little less than abhorrent. Their dislike of
      it was based, of course, on weightier grounds than its occasional
      interference in matters of business. But their attitude had as an
      inevitable result that, with the disparagement of the whole principle of
      the traditional ecclesiastical discipline, that particular use of it was
      also discredited. It was not that Puritanism implied a greater laxity in
      social relations. On the contrary, in its earlier phases it stood, at
      least in theory, for a stricter discipline of the life of the individual,
      alike in his business and in his pleasures. But it repudiated as
      anti-Christian the organs through which such discipline had in fact been
      exercised. When the Usury Bill of 1571 was being discussed in the House of
      Commons, reference to the canon law was met by the protest that the rules
      of the canon law on the matter were abolished, and that “they should be no
      more remembered than they are followed.”[<a href="#footnote-3-91"
      id="noteref-3-91">91</a>] Feeling against the system rose steadily during
      the next two generations; excommunications, when courts ventured to resort
      to them, were freely disregarded;[<a href="#footnote-3-92"
      id="noteref-3-92">92</a>] and by the thirties of the seventeenth century,
      under the influence of Laud’s <i lang="fr">régime</i>, the murmur was
      threatening to become a hurricane. Then came the Long Parliament, the
      fierce denunciations in both Houses of the interference of the clergy in
      civil affairs, and the legislation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg
      188]</span> abolishing the Court of High Commission, depriving the
      ordinary ecclesiastical courts of penal jurisdiction, and finally, with
      the abolition of episcopacy, sweeping them away altogether.</p>
      <p>“Not many good days,” wrote Penn, “since ministers meddled so much in
      laymen’s business.”[<a href="#footnote-3-93" id="noteref-3-93">93</a>]
      That sentiment was a dogma on which, after the Restoration, both Cavalier
      and Roundhead could agree. It inevitably reacted, not only upon the
      practical powers of the clergy, which in any case had long been feeble,
      but on the whole conception of religion which regarded it as involving the
      control of economic self-interest by what Laud had called “the body of the
      Church.” The works of Sanderson and of Jeremy Taylor, continuing an
      earlier tradition, reasserted with force and eloquence the view that the
      Christian is bound by his faith to a rule of life which finds expression
      in equity in bargaining and in works of mercy to his neighbors.[<a
      href="#footnote-3-94" id="noteref-3-94">94</a>] But the conception that
      the Church possessed, of its own authority, an independent standard of
      social values, which it could apply as a criterion to the practical
      affairs of the economic world, grew steadily weaker. The result, neither
      immediate nor intended, but inevitable, was the tacit denial of spiritual
      significance in the transactions of business and in the relations of
      organized society. Repudiating the right of religion to advance any social
      theory distinctively its own, that attitude became itself the most
      tyrannical and paralyzing of theories. It may be called
      Indifferentism.</p>
      <p>The change had begun before the Civil War. It was completed with the
      Restoration, and, still more, with the Revolution. In the eighteenth
      century it is almost superfluous to examine the teaching of the Church of
      England as to social ethics. For it brings no distinctive contribution,
      and, except by a few eccentrics, the very conception of the Church as an
      independent moral authority, whose standards<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span> may be in sharp antithesis to social
      conventions, has been abandoned.</p>
      <p>An institution which possesses no philosophy of its own inevitably
      accepts that which happens to be fashionable. What set the tone of social
      thought in the eighteenth century was partly the new Political Arithmetic,
      which had come to maturity at the Restoration, and which, as was to be
      expected in the first great age of English natural science—the age of
      Newton, of Halley, and of the Royal Society—drew its inspiration, not from
      religion or morals, but from mathematics and physics. It was still more
      the political theory associated with the name of Locke, but popularized
      and debased by a hundred imitators. Society is not a community of classes
      with varying functions, united to each other by mutual obligations arising
      from their relation to a common end. It is a joint-stock company rather
      than an organism, and the liabilities of the shareholders are strictly
      limited. They enter it in order to insure the rights already vested in
      them by the immutable laws of nature. The State, a matter of convenience,
      not of supernatural sanctions, exists for the protection of those rights,
      and fulfills its object in so far as, by maintaining contractual freedom,
      it secures full scope for their unfettered exercise.</p>
      <p>The most important of such rights are property rights, and property
      rights attach mainly, though not, of course, exclusively, to the higher
      orders of men, who hold the tangible, material “stock” of society. Those
      who do not subscribe to the company have no legal claim to a share in the
      profits, though they have a moral claim on the charity of their superiors.
      Hence the curious phraseology which treats almost all below the nobility,
      gentry and freeholders as “the poor”—and the poor, it is well known, are
      of two kinds, “the industrious poor,” who work for their betters, and “the
      idle poor,” who work for themselves. Hence the unending<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span> discussions as to whether
      “the laboring poor” are to be classed among the “productive” or
      “unproductive” classes—whether they are, or are not, really worth their
      keep. Hence the indignant repudiation of the suggestion that any
      substantial amelioration of their lot could be effected by any kind of
      public policy. “It would be easier, where property was well secured, to
      live without money than without poor, ... who, as they ought to be kept
      from starving, so they should receive nothing worth saving”; the poor
      “have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants, which it
      is prudence to relieve, but folly to cure”; “to make society happy, it is
      necessary that great numbers should be wretched as well as poor.”[<a
      href="#footnote-3-95" id="noteref-3-95">95</a>] Such sentences from a work
      printed in 1714 are not typical. But they are straws which show how the
      wind is blowing.</p>
      <p>In such an atmosphere temperatures were naturally low and equable, and
      enthusiasm, if not a lapse in morals, was an intellectual solecism and an
      error in taste. Religious thought was not immune from the same influence.
      It was not merely that the Church, which, as much as the State, was the
      heir of the Revolution settlement, reproduced the temper of an
      aristocratic society, as it reproduced its class organization and economic
      inequalities, and was disposed too often to idealize as a virtue that
      habit of mean subservience to wealth and social position, which, after
      more than half a century of political democracy, is still the
      characteristic and odious vice of Englishmen. Not less significant was the
      fact that, apart from certain groups and certain questions, it accepted
      the prevalent social philosophy and adapted its teaching to it. The age in
      which political theory was cast in the mould of religion had yielded to
      one in which religious thought was no longer an imperious master, but a
      docile pupil. Conspicuous exceptions like Law, who reasserted with
      matchless power the idea that Christianity implies a distinctive way of
      life, or protests like Wesley’s sermon on<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> <i>The Use of Money</i>, merely heighten the
      impression of a general acquiescence in the conventional ethics. The
      prevalent religious thought might not unfairly be described as morality
      tempered by prudence, and softened on occasion by a rather sentimental
      compassion for inferiors. It was the natural counterpart of a social
      philosophy which repudiated teleology, and which substituted the analogy
      of a self-regulating mechanism, moved by the weights and pulleys of
      economic motives, for the theory which had regarded society as an organism
      composed of different classes united by their common subordination to a
      spiritual purpose.</p>
      <p>Such an attitude, with its emphasis on the economic harmony of
      apparently conflicting interests, left small scope for moral casuistry.
      The materials for the reformer were, indeed, abundant enough. The
      phenomena of early commercial capitalism—consider only the orgy of
      financial immorality which culminated in 1720—were of a kind which might
      have been expected to shock even the not over-sensitive conscience of the
      eighteenth century. Two centuries before, the Fuggers had been denounced
      by preachers and theologians; and, compared with the men who engineered
      the South Sea Bubble, the Fuggers had been innocents. In reality,
      religious opinion was quite unmoved by the spectacle. The traditional
      scheme of social ethics had been worked out in a simpler age; in the
      commercial England of banking, and shipping, and joint-stock enterprise,
      it seemed, and was called, a Gothic superstition. From the Restoration
      onward it was quietly dropped. The usurer and engrosser disappear from
      episcopal charges. In the popular manual called <i>The Whole Duty of
      Man</i>,[<a href="#footnote-3-96" id="noteref-3-96">96</a>] first
      published in 1658, and widely read during the following century, extortion
      and oppression still figure as sins, but the attempt to define what they
      are is frankly abandoned. If preachers have not yet overtly identified
      themselves with the view of the natural man, expressed by an
      eighteenth-century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
      writer in the words, “trade is one thing and religion is another,” they
      imply a not very different conclusion by their silence as to the
      possibility of collisions between them. The characteristic doctrine was
      one, in fact, which left little room for religious teaching as to economic
      morality, because it anticipated the theory, later epitomized by Adam
      Smith in his famous reference to the invisible hand, which saw in economic
      self-interest the operation of a providential plan. “National commerce,
      good morals and good government,” wrote Dean Tucker, of whom Warburton
      unkindly said that religion was his trade, and trade his religion, “are
      but part of one general scheme, in the designs of Providence.”</p>
      <p>Naturally, on such a view, it was unnecessary for the Church to insist
      on commercial morality, since sound morality coincided with commercial
      wisdom. The existing order, except in so far as the short-sighted
      enactments of Governments interfered with it, was the natural order, and
      the order established by nature was the order established by God. Most
      educated men, in the middle of the century, would have found their
      philosophy expressed in the lines of Pope:</p>
      <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
          <div class="stanza">
            <div class="verse indent0">Thus God and Nature formed the general
            frame,</div>
            <div class="verse indent0">And bade self-love and social be the
            same.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="continued">Naturally, again, such an attitude precluded a
      critical examination of institutions, and left as the sphere of Christian
      charity only those parts of life which could be reserved for philanthropy,
      precisely because they fell outside that larger area of normal human
      relations, in which the promptings of self-interest provided an
      all-sufficient motive and rule of conduct. It was, therefore, in the
      sphere of providing succor for the non-combatants and for the wounded, not
      in inspiring the main army, that the social work of the Church<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> was conceived to lie. Its
      characteristic expressions in the eighteenth century were the relief of
      the poor, the care of the sick, and the establishment of schools. In spite
      of the genuine, if somewhat unctuous, solicitude for the spiritual welfare
      of the poorer classes, which inspired the Evangelical revival, religion
      abandoned the fundamental brain-work of criticism and construction to the
      rationalist and the humanitarian.</p>
      <p>Surprise has sometimes been expressed that the Church should not have
      been more effective in giving inspiration and guidance during the immense
      economic reorganization to which tradition has assigned the not very
      felicitous name of the “Industrial Revolution.” It did not give it,
      because it did not possess it. There were, no doubt, special conditions to
      account for its silence—mere ignorance and inefficiency, the supposed
      teachings of political economy, and, after 1790, the terror of all
      humanitarian movements inspired by France. But the explanation of its
      attitude is to be sought, less in the peculiar circumstances of the
      moment, than in the prevalence of a temper which accepted the established
      order of class relations as needing no vindication before any higher
      tribunal, and which made religion, not its critic or its accuser, but its
      anodyne, its apologist, and its drudge. It was not that there was any
      relapse into abnormal inhumanity. It was that the very idea that the
      Church possessed an independent standard of values, to which social
      institutions were amenable, had been abandoned. The surrender had been
      made long before the battle began. The spiritual blindness which made
      possible the general acquiescence in the horrors of the early factory
      system was, not a novelty, but the habit of a century.</p>

      <hr>
      <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>By the end of the
      sixteenth century the divorce between religious theory and economic
      realities had long been evident. But in the meantime, within the bosom of
      religious theory itself, a new system of ideas was being matured, which
      was destined to revolutionize all traditional values, and to turn on the
      whole field of social obligations a new and penetrating light. On a world
      heaving with expanding energies, and on a Church uncertain of itself,
      rose, after two generations of premonitory mutterings, the tremendous
      storm of the Puritan movement. The forest bent; the oaks snapped; the dry
      leaves were driven before a gale, neither all of winter nor all of spring,
      but violent and life-giving, pitiless and tender, sounding strange notes
      of yearning and contrition, as of voices wrung from a people dwelling in
      Meshec, which signifies Prolonging, in Kedar, which signifies Blackness;
      while amid the blare of trumpets, and the clash of arms, and the rending
      of the carved work of the Temple, humble to God and haughty to man, the
      soldier-saints swept over battlefield and scaffold their garments rolled
      in blood.</p>
      <p>In the great silence which fell when the Titans had turned to dust, in
      the Augustan calm of the eighteenth century, a voice was heard to observe
      that religious liberty was a considerable advantage, regarded “merely in a
      commercial view.”[<a href="#footnote-4-1" id="noteref-4-1">1</a>] A new
      world, it was evident, had arisen. And this new world, born of the vision
      of the mystic, the passion of the prophet, the sweat and agony of heroes
      famous and unknown, as well as of mundane ambitions and commonplace
      cupidities, was one in which, since “Thorough”<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span> was no more, since property was secure, and
      contracts inviolable, and the executive tamed, the judicious investments
      of business men were likely to yield a profitable return. So the epitaph,
      which crowns the life of what is called success, mocks the dreams in which
      youth hungered, not for success, but for the glorious failure of the
      martyr or the saint.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-4-1"><abbr title="1">I</abbr>. PURITANISM AND SOCIETY</h3>
      <p>The principal streams which descended in England from the teaching of
      Calvin were three—Presbyterianism, Congregationalism, and a doctrine of
      the nature of God and man, which, if common to both, was more widely
      diffused, more pervasive and more potent than either. Of these three
      off-shoots from the parent stem, the first and eldest, which had made some
      stir under Elizabeth, and which it was hoped, with judicious watering from
      the Scotch, might grow into a State Church, was to produce a credal
      statement carved in bronze, but was to strike, at least in its original
      guise, but slender roots. The second, with its insistence on the right of
      every Church to organize itself, and on the freedom of all Churches from
      the interference of the State, was to leave, alike in the Old World and in
      the New, an imperishable legacy of civil and religious liberty. The third
      was Puritanism. Straitened to no single sect, and represented in the
      Anglican Church hardly, if at all, less fully than in those which
      afterwards separated from it, it determined, not only conceptions of
      theology and church government, but political aspirations, business
      relations, family life and the <i lang="la">minutiæ</i> of personal
      behavior.</p>
      <p>The growth, triumph and transformation of the Puritan spirit was the
      most fundamental movement of the seventeenth century. Puritanism, not the
      Tudor secession from Rome, was the true English Reformation, and it is
      from its struggle against the old order that an England which is<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> unmistakably modern emerges.
      But, immense as were its accomplishments on the high stage of public
      affairs, its achievements in that inner world, of which politics are but
      the squalid scaffolding, were mightier still. Like an iceberg, which can
      awe the traveller by its towering majesty only because sustained by a
      vaster mass which escapes his eye, the revolution which Puritanism wrought
      in Church and State was less than that which it worked in men’s souls, and
      the watchwords which it thundered, amid the hum of Parliaments and the
      roar of battles, had been learned in the lonely nights, when Jacob
      wrestled with the angel of the Lord to wring a blessing before he
      fled.</p>
      <div class="poetry-container">
        <div class="poetry">
          <div class="stanza">

            <div class="verse indent0">To offer it the show of violence.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="continued">In the mysticism of Bunyan and Fox, in the brooding
      melancholy and glowing energy of Cromwell, in the victorious tranquillity
      of Milton, “unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,” amid a world of
      self-seekers and apostates, there are depths of light and darkness which
      posterity can observe with reverence or with horror, but which its small
      fathom-line cannot plumb.</p>
      <p>There are types of character which are like a prism, whose various and
      brilliant colors are but broken reflections of a single ray of
      concentrated light. If the inward and spiritual grace of Puritanism eludes
      the historian, its outward and visible signs meet him at every turn, and
      not less in market-place and counting-house and camp than in the student’s
      chamber and the gathering of the elect for prayer. For to the Puritan, a
      contemner of the vain shows of sacramentalism, mundane toil becomes itself
      a kind of sacrament. Like a man who strives by unresting activity to
      exorcise a haunting demon, the Puritan, in the effort to save his own
      soul, sets in motion every force in heaven above or in the earth beneath.
      By the mere energy of his expanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg
      200]</span> spirit, he remakes, not only his own character and habits and
      way of life, but family and church, industry and city, political
      institutions and social order. Conscious that he is but a stranger and
      pilgrim, hurrying from this transitory life to a life to come, he turns
      with almost physical horror from the vanities which lull into an awful
      indifference souls dwelling on the borders of eternity, to pore with
      anguish of spirit on the grand facts, God, the soul, salvation and
      damnation. “It made the world seem to me,” said a Puritan of his
      conversion, “as a carkass that had neither life nor loveliness. And it
      destroyed those ambitious desires after literate fame, which was the sin
      of my childhood.... It set me upon that method of my studies which since
      then I have found the benefit of.... It caused me first to seek God’s
      Kingdom and his Righteousness, and most to mind the One thing needful, and
      to determine first of my Ultimate End.”[<a href="#footnote-4-2"
      id="noteref-4-2">2</a>]</p>
      <p>Overwhelmed by a sense of his “Ultimate End,” the Puritan cannot rest,
      nevertheless, in reflection upon it. The contemplation of God, which the
      greatest of the Schoolmen described as the supreme blessedness, is a
      blessedness too great for sinners, who must not only contemplate God, but
      glorify him by their work in a world given over to the powers of darkness.
      “The way to the Celestial City lies just through this town, where this
      lusty fair is kept; and he that will go to the City, and yet not go
      through this town, must needs go out of the world.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-3" id="noteref-4-3">3</a>] For that awful journey, girt
      with precipices and beset with fiends, he sheds every encumbrance, and
      arms himself with every weapon. Amusements, books, even intercourse with
      friends, must, if need be, be cast aside; for it is better to enter into
      eternal life halt and maimed than having two eyes to be cast into eternal
      fire. He scours the country, like Baxter and Fox, to find one who may
      speak the word of life to his soul. He seeks from his ministers, not
      absolution, but instruction, exhortation and<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span> warning. Prophesyings—that most revealing
      episode in early Puritanism—were the cry of a famished generation for
      enlightenment, for education, for a religion of the intellect; and it was
      because much “preaching breeds faction, but much praying causes
      devotion”[<a href="#footnote-4-4" id="noteref-4-4">4</a>] that the powers
      of this world raised their parchment shutters to stem the gale that blew
      from the Puritan pulpit. He disciplines, rationalizes, systematizes, his
      life; “method” was a Puritan catchword a century before the world had
      heard of Methodists. He makes his very business a travail of the spirit,
      for that too is the Lord’s vineyard, in which he is called to labor.</p>
      <p>Feeling in him that which “maketh him more fearful of displeasing God
      than all the world,”[<a href="#footnote-4-5" id="noteref-4-5">5</a>] he is
      a natural republican, for there is none on earth that he can own as
      master. If powers and principalities will hear and obey, well; if not,
      they must be ground into dust, that on their ruins the elect may build the
      Kingdom of Christ. And, in the end, all these—prayer, and toil, and
      discipline, mastery of self and mastery of others, wounds, and death—may
      be too little for the salvation of a single soul. “Then I saw that there
      was a way to Hell even from the Gates of Heaven, as well as from the City
      of Destruction”[<a href="#footnote-4-6" id="noteref-4-6">6</a>]—those
      dreadful words haunt him as he nears his end. Sometimes they break his
      heart. More often, for grace abounds even to the chief of sinners, they
      nerve his will. For it is will—will organized and disciplined and
      inspired, will quiescent in rapt adoration or straining in violent energy,
      but always will—which is the essence of Puritanism, and for the
      intensification and organization of will every instrument in that
      tremendous arsenal of religious fervour is mobilized. The Puritan is like
      a steel spring compressed by an inner force, which shatters every obstacle
      by its rebound. Sometimes the strain is too tense, and, when its
      imprisoned energy is released, it shatters itself.</p>
      <p>The spirit bloweth where it listeth, and men of every social<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span> grade had felt their hearts
      lifted by its breath, from aristocrats and country gentlemen to weavers
      who, “as they stand in their loom, can set a book before them or edifie
      one another.”[<a href="#footnote-4-7" id="noteref-4-7">7</a>] But, if
      religious zeal and moral enthusiasm are not straitened by the vulgar
      categories of class and income, experience proves, nevertheless, that
      there are certain kinds of environment in which they burn more bravely
      than in others, and that, as man is both spirit and body, so different
      types of religious experience correspond to the varying needs of different
      social and economic <i lang="fr">milieux</i>. To contemporaries the chosen
      seat of the Puritan spirit seemed to be those classes in society which
      combined economic independence, education and a certain decent pride in
      their status, revealed at once in a determination to live their own lives,
      without truckling to earthly superiors, and in a somewhat arrogant
      contempt for those who, either through weakness of character or through
      economic helplessness, were less resolute, less vigorous and masterful,
      than themselves. Such, where the feudal spirit had been weakened by
      contact with town life and new intellectual currents, were some of the
      gentry. Such, conspicuously, were the yeomen, “mounted on a high spirit,
      as being slaves to none,”[<a href="#footnote-4-8" id="noteref-4-8">8</a>]
      especially in the freeholding counties of the east. Such, above all, were
      the trading classes of the towns, and of those rural districts which had
      been partially industrialized by the decentralization of the textile and
      iron industries.</p>
      <p>“The King’s cause and party,” wrote one who described the situation in
      Bristol in 1645, “were favored by two extremes in that city; the one, the
      wealthy and powerful men, the other, of the basest and lowest sort; but
      disgusted by the middle rank, the true and best citizens.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-9" id="noteref-4-9">9</a>] That it was everywhere these
      classes who were the standard-bearers of Puritanism is suggested by
      Professor Usher’s statistical estimate of the distribution of Puritan
      ministers in the first decade of the seventeenth century, which shows
      that, of 281<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> ministers
      whose names are known, 35 belonged to London and Middlesex, 96 to the
      three manufacturing counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, 29 to
      Northamptonshire, 17 to Lancashire, and only 104 to the whole of the rest
      of the country.[<a href="#footnote-4-10" id="noteref-4-10">10</a>] The
      phenomenon was so striking as to evoke the comments of contemporaries
      absorbed in matters of profounder spiritual import than sociological
      generalization. “Most of the tenants of these gentlemen,” wrote Baxter,
      “and also most of the poorest of the people, whom the other called the
      Rabble, did follow the gentry, and were for the King. On the Parliament’s
      side were (besides themselves) the smaller part (as some thought) of the
      gentry in most of the counties, and freeholders, and the middle sort of
      men; especially in those corporations and counties which depend on
      cloathing and such manufactures.” He explained the fact by the
      liberalizing effect of constant correspondence with the greater centers of
      trade, and cited the example of France, where it was “the merchants and
      middle sort of men that were Protestants.”[<a href="#footnote-4-11"
      id="noteref-4-11">11</a>]</p>
      <p>The most conspicuous example was, of course, London, which had financed
      the Parliamentary forces, and which continued down to the Revolution to be
      <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> “the rebellious city,” returning four
      Dissenters to the Royalist Parliament of 1661, sending its mayor and
      aldermen to accompany Lord Russell when he carried the Exclusion Bill from
      the Commons to the Lords, patronizing Presbyterian ministers long after
      Presbyterianism was proscribed, nursing the Whig Party, which stood for
      tolerance, and sheltering the Whig leaders against the storm which broke
      in 1681. But almost everywhere the same fact was to be observed. The
      growth of Puritanism, wrote a hostile critic, was “by meanes of the City
      of London (the nest and seminary of the seditious faction) and by reason
      of its universall trade throughout the kingdome, with its commodities
      conveying and deriving this civill contagion to all our cities<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> and corporations, and
      thereby poysoning whole counties.”[<a href="#footnote-4-12"
      id="noteref-4-12">12</a>] In Lancashire, the clothing towns—“the Genevas
      of Lancashire”—rose like Puritan islands from the surrounding sea of Roman
      Catholicism. In Yorkshire, Bradford, Leeds and Halifax; in the midlands,
      Birmingham and Leicester; in the west, Gloucester, Taunton and Exeter, the
      capital of the west of England textile industry, were all centers of
      Puritanism.</p>
      <p>The identification of the industrial and commercial classes with
      religious radicalism was, indeed, a constant theme of Anglicans and
      Royalists, who found in the vices of each an additional reason for
      distrusting both. Clarendon commented bitterly on the “factious humor
      which possessed most corporations, and the pride of their wealth”;[<a
      href="#footnote-4-13" id="noteref-4-13">13</a>] and, after the Civil War,
      both the politics and the religion of the boroughs were suspect for a
      generation. The bishop of Oxford warned Charles <abbr title="the
      second">II</abbr>’s Government against showing them any favor, on the
      ground that “trading combinations” were “so many nests of faction and
      sedition,” and that “our late miserable distractions” were “chiefly
      hatched in the shops of tradesmen.”[<a href="#footnote-4-14"
      id="noteref-4-14">14</a>] Pepys commented dryly on the black looks which
      met the Anglican clergy as they returned to their City churches. It was
      even alleged that the courtiers hailed with glee the fire of London, as a
      providential instrument for crippling the center of disaffection.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-15" id="noteref-4-15">15</a>]</p>
      <p>When, after 1660, Political Arithmetic became the fashion, its
      practitioners were moved by the experience of the last half-century and by
      the example of Holland—the economic schoolmaster of seventeenth-century
      Europe—to inquire, in the manner of any modern sociologist, into the
      relations between economic progress and other aspects of the national
      genius. Cool, dispassionate, very weary of the drum ecclesiastic, they
      confirmed, not without some notes of gentle irony, the diagnosis of bishop
      and presbyterian, but deduced from it different conclusions. The question
      which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> gave a topical
      point to their analysis was the rising issue of religious tolerance.
      Serenely indifferent to its spiritual significance, they found a practical
      reason for applauding it in the fact that the classes who were in the van
      of the Puritan movement, and in whom the Clarendon Code found its most
      prominent victims, were also those who led commercial and industrial
      enterprise. The explanation, they thought, was simple. A society of
      peasants could be homogeneous in its religion, as it was already
      homogeneous in the simple uniformity of its economic arrangements. A
      many-sided business community could escape constant friction and
      obstruction only if it were free to absorb elements drawn from a multitude
      of different sources, and if each of those elements were free to pursue
      its own way of life, and—in that age the same thing—to practice its own
      religion.</p>
      <p>Englishmen, as Defoe remarked, improved everything and invented
      nothing, and English economic organization had long been elastic enough to
      swallow Flemish weavers flying from Alva, and Huguenots driven from
      France. But the traditional ecclesiastical system was not equally
      accommodating. It found not only the alien refugee, but its home-bred
      sectaries, indigestible. Laud, reversing the policy of Elizabethan Privy
      Councils, which characteristically thought diversity of trades more
      important than unity of religion, had harassed the settlements of foreign
      artisans at Maidstone, Sandwich and Canterbury,[<a href="#footnote-4-16"
      id="noteref-4-16">16</a>] and the problem recurred in every attempt to
      enforce conformity down to 1689. “The gaols were crowded with the most
      substantial tradesmen and inhabitants, the clothiers were forced from
      their houses, and thousands of workmen and women whom they employed set to
      starving.”[<a href="#footnote-4-17" id="noteref-4-17">17</a>] The Whig
      indictment of the disastrous effects of Tory policy recalls the picture
      drawn by French <i lang="fr">intendants</i> of the widespread distress
      which followed the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-18" id="noteref-4-18">18</a>]</p>
      <p>When the collision between economic interests and the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
      policy of compulsory conformity was so flagrant, it is not surprising that
      the economists of the age should have enunciated the healing principle
      that persecution was incompatible with prosperity, since it was on the
      pioneers of economic progress that persecution principally fell. “Every
      law of this nature,” wrote the author of a pamphlet on the subject, is not
      only “expressly against the very principles and rules of the Gospel of
      Christ,” but is also “destructive to the trade and well-being of our
      nation by oppressing and driving away the most industrious working hands,
      and depopulating, and thereby impoverishes our country, which is capable
      of employing ten times the number of people we now have.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-19" id="noteref-4-19">19</a>]</p>
      <p>Temple, in his calm and lucid study of the United Netherlands, found
      one reason of their success in the fact that, Roman Catholicism excepted,
      every man might practise what religion he pleased.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-20" id="noteref-4-20">20</a>] De la Court, whose
      striking book passed under the name of John de Witt, said the same.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-21" id="noteref-4-21">21</a>] Petty, after pointing out
      that in England the most thriving towns were those where there was most
      nonconformity, cited the evidence, not only of Europe, but of India and
      the Ottoman Empire, to prove that, while economic progress is compatible
      with any religion, the class which is its vehicle will always consist of
      the heterodox minority, who “profess opinions different from what are
      publicly established.”[<a href="#footnote-4-22" id="noteref-4-22">22</a>]
      “There is a kind of natural unaptness,” wrote a pamphleteer in 1671, “in
      the Popish religion to business, whereas on the contrary among the
      Reformed, the greater their zeal, the greater their inclination to trade
      and industry, as holding idleness unlawful.... The domestic interest of
      England lieth in the advancement of trade by removing all obstructions
      both in city and country, and providing such laws as may help it, and make
      it most easy, especially in giving liberty of conscience to all Protestant
      Nonconformists, and denying it to Papists.”<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>[<a href="#footnote-4-23"
      id="noteref-4-23">23</a>]</p>
      <p>If the economists applauded tolerance because it was good for trade,
      the Tory distrust of the commercial classes was aggravated by the fact
      that it was they who were most vocal in the demand for tolerance. Swift
      denounced, as part of the same odious creed, the maxim that “religion
      ought to make no distinction between Protestants” and the policy “of
      preferring, on all occasions, the monied interests before the landed.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-24" id="noteref-4-24">24</a>] Even later in the
      eighteenth century, the stale gibe of “the Presbyterians, the Bank and the
      other corporations” still figured in the pamphlets of the statesman whom
      Lord Morley describes as the prince of political charlatans,
      Bolingbroke.[<a href="#footnote-4-25" id="noteref-4-25">25</a>]</p>
      <p>“The middle ranks,” “the middle class of men,” “the middle sort”—such
      social strata included, of course, the widest variety of economic interest
      and personal position. But in the formative period of Puritanism, before
      the Civil War, two causes prevented the phrase from being merely the vapid
      substitute for thought which it is today. In the first place, outside
      certain exceptional industries and districts, there was little large-scale
      production and no massed proletariat of propertyless wage-earners. As a
      result, the typical workman was still normally a small master, who
      continued himself to work at the loom or at the forge, and whose position
      was that described in Baxter’s Kidderminster, where “there were none of
      the tradesmen very rich ... the magistrates of the town were few of them
      worth £40 <i lang="la">per annum</i>, and most not half so much; three or
      four of the richest thriving masters of the trade got but about £500 to
      £600 in twenty years, and it may be lost £100 of it at once by an ill
      debtor.”[<a href="#footnote-4-26" id="noteref-4-26">26</a>] Differing in
      wealth from the prosperous merchant or clothier, such men resembled them
      in economic and social habits, and the distinction between them was one of
      degree, not of kind. In the world of industry vertical divisions between
      district and district still cut deeper than horizontal fissures between
      class and class.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
      The number of those who could reasonably be described as independent,
      since they owned their own tools and controlled their own businesses,
      formed a far larger proportion of the population than is the case in
      capitalist societies.</p>
      <p>The second fact was even more decisive. The business classes, as a
      power in the State, were still sufficiently young to be conscious of
      themselves as something like a separate order, with an outlook on religion
      and politics peculiarly their own, distinguished, not merely by birth and
      breeding, but by their social habits, their business discipline, the whole
      bracing atmosphere of their moral life, from a Court which they believed
      to be godless and an aristocracy which they knew to be spendthrift. The
      estrangement—for it was no more—was of shorter duration in England than in
      any other European country, except Switzerland and Holland. By the latter
      part of the seventeenth century, partly as a result of the common
      struggles which made the Revolution, still more perhaps through the
      redistribution of wealth by commerce and finance, the former rivals were
      on the way to be compounded in the gilded clay of a plutocracy embracing
      both. The landed gentry were increasingly sending their sons into
      business; “the tradesman meek and much a liar” looked forward, as a matter
      of course, to buying an estate from a bankrupt noble. Georgian England was
      to astonish foreign observers, like Voltaire and Montesquieu, as the
      Paradise of the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, in which the prosperous
      merchant shouldered easily aside the impoverished bearers of aristocratic
      names.[<a href="#footnote-4-27" id="noteref-4-27">27</a>]</p>
      <p>That consummation, however, was subsequent to the great divide of the
      Civil War, and, in the main, to the tamer glories of the Revolution. In
      the germinating period of Puritanism, the commercial classes, though
      powerful, were not yet the dominant force which a century later they were
      to become. They could look back on a not distant past, in which their
      swift rise to prosperity had been regarded<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span> with suspicion, as the emergence of an alien
      interest, which applied sordid means to the pursuit of anti-social ends—an
      interest for which in a well-ordered commonwealth there was little room,
      and which had been rapped on the knuckles by conservative statesmen. They
      lived in a present, where a Government, at once interfering, inefficient
      and extravagant, cultivated, with an intolerable iteration of
      grandiloquent principles, every shift and artifice most repugnant to the
      sober prudence of plain-dealing men. The less reputable courtiers and the
      more feather-pated provincial gentry, while courting them to raise a
      mortgage or renew a loan, reviled them as <i lang="fr">parvenus</i>,
      usurers and blood-suckers. Even in the latter part of the seventeenth
      century, the influence of the <i lang="fr">rentier</i> and of the
      financier still continued to cause apprehension and jealousy, both for
      political and for economic reasons. “By this single stratagem,” wrote an
      indignant pamphleteer of the Puritan capitalists who specialized in
      money-lending, “they avoyd all contributions of tithes and taxes to the
      King, Church, Poor (a soverain cordial to tender consciences); they
      decline all services and offices of burthen incident to visible estates;
      they escape all oaths and ties of publick allegiance or private fealty....
      They enjoy both the secular applause of prudent conduct, and withal the
      spiritual comfort of thriving easily and devoutly ... leaving their
      adversaries the censures of improvidence, together with the misery of
      decay. They keep many of the nobility and gentry in perfect vassalage (as
      their poor copyholders), which eclipses honour, enervates justice and
      oft-times protects them in their boldest conceptions. By engrossing cash
      and credit, they in effect give the price to land and law to markets. By
      commanding ready money, they likewise command such offices as they widely
      affect ... they feather and enlarge their own nests, the corporations.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-28" id="noteref-4-28">28</a>]</p>
      <p>Such lamentations, the protest of senatorial dignity against equestrian
      upstarts or of the <i lang="fr">noblesse</i> against the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span> <i>roturier</i>, were
      natural in a conservative aristocracy, which for a century had felt
      authority and prestige slipping from its grasp, and which could only
      maintain its hold on them by resigning itself, as ultimately it did, to
      sharing them with its rival. In return, the business world, which had its
      own religious and political ideology, steadily gathered the realities of
      power into its own hands; asked with a sneer, “how would merchants thrive
      if gentlemen would not be unthriftes”;[<a href="#footnote-4-29"
      id="noteref-4-29">29</a>] and vented the indignant contempt felt by an
      energetic, successful and, according to its lights, not too unscrupulous,
      generation for a class of <i lang="fr">fainéants</i>, unversed in the new
      learning of the City and incompetent to the verge of immorality in the
      management of business affairs. Their triumphs in the past, their strength
      in the present, their confidence in the future, their faith in themselves,
      and their difference from their feebler neighbours—a difference as of an
      iron wedge in a lump of clay—made them, to use a modern phrase,
      class-conscious. Like the modern proletarian, who feels that, whatever his
      personal misery and his present disappointments, the Cause is rolled
      forward to victory by the irresistible force of an inevitable evolution,
      the Puritan <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> knew that against the chosen
      people the gates of hell could not prevail. The Lord prospered their
      doings.</p>
      <p>There is a magic mirror in which each order and organ of society, as
      the consciousness of its character and destiny dawns upon it, looks for a
      moment, before the dust of conflict or the glamour of success obscures its
      vision. In that enchanted glass, it sees its own lineaments reflected with
      ravishing allurements; for what it sees is not what it is, but what in the
      eyes of mankind and of its own heart it would be. The feudal <i
      lang="fr">noblesse</i> had looked, and had caught a glimpse of a world of
      fealty and chivalry and honor. The monarchy looked, or Laud and Strafford
      looked for it; they saw a nation drinking the blessings of material
      prosperity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span> and
      spiritual edification from the cornucopia of a sage and paternal
      monarchy—a nation “fortified and adorned ... the country rich ... the
      Church flourishing ... trade increased to that degree that we were the
      exchange of Christendom ... all foreign merchants looking upon nothing as
      their own but what they laid up in the warehouses of this Kingdom.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-30" id="noteref-4-30">30</a>] In a far-off day the
      craftsman and laborer were to look, and see a band of comrades, where
      fellowship should be known for life and lack of fellowship for death. For
      the middle classes of the early seventeenth century, rising but not yet
      triumphant, that enchanted mirror was Puritanism. What it showed was a
      picture grave to sternness, yet not untouched with a sober exaltation—an
      earnest, zealous, godly generation, scorning delights, punctual in labor,
      constant in prayer, thrifty and thriving, filled with a decent pride in
      themselves and their calling, assured that strenuous toil is acceptable to
      Heaven, a people like those Dutch Calvinists whose economic triumphs were
      as famous as their iron Protestantism—“thinking, sober, and patient men,
      and such as believe that labor and industry is their duty towards God.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-31" id="noteref-4-31">31</a>] Then an air stirred and
      the glass was dimmed. It was long before any questioned it again.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-4-2"><abbr title="2">II</abbr>. A GODLY DISCIPLINE <i
      lang="la">versus</i> THE RELIGION OF TRADE</h3>
      <p>Puritanism was the schoolmaster of the English middle classes. It
      heightened their virtues, sanctified, without eradicating, their
      convenient vices, and gave them an inexpugnable assurance that, behind
      virtues and vices alike, stood the majestic and inexorable laws of an
      omnipotent Providence, without whose foreknowledge not a hammer could beat
      upon the forge, not a figure could be added to the ledger. But it is a
      strange school which does not teach more than one lesson, and the social
      reactions of Puritanism, trenchant, permanent and profound, are not to be
      summarized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span> in the
      simple formula that it fostered individualism. Weber, in a celebrated
      essay, expounded the thesis that Calvinism, in its English version, was
      the parent of capitalism, and Troeltsch, Schulze-Gaevernitz and Cunningham
      have lent to the same interpretation the weight of their considerable
      authority.[<a href="#footnote-4-32" id="noteref-4-32">32</a>] But the
      heart of man holds mysteries of contradiction which live in vigorous
      incompatibility together. When the shriveled tissues lie in our hand, the
      spiritual bond still eludes us.</p>
      <p>In every human soul there is a socialist and an individualist, an
      authoritarian and a fanatic for liberty, as in each there is a Catholic
      and a Protestant. The same is true of the mass movements in which men
      marshal themselves for common action. There was in Puritanism an element
      which was conservative and traditionalist, and an element which was
      revolutionary; a collectivism which grasped at an iron discipline, and an
      individualism which spurned the savorless mess of human ordinances; a
      sober prudence which would garner the fruits of this world, and a divine
      recklessness which would make all things new. For long nourished together,
      their discords concealed, in the furnace of the Civil War they fell apart,
      and Presbyterian and Independent, aristocrat and Leveller, politician and
      merchant and utopian, gazed with bewildered eyes on the strange monsters
      with whom they had walked as friends. Then the splendors and illusions
      vanished; the force of common things prevailed; the metal cooled in the
      mould; and the Puritan spirit, shorn of its splendors and its illusions,
      settled finally into its decent bed of equable respectability. But each
      element in its social philosophy had once been as vital as the other, and
      the battle was fought, not between a Puritanism solid for one view and a
      State committed to another, but between rival tendencies in the soul of
      Puritanism itself. The problem is to grasp their connection, and to
      understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> the reasons
      which caused this to wax and that to wane.</p>
      <p>“The triumph of Puritanism,” it has been said, “swept away all traces
      of any restriction or guidance in the employment of money.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-33" id="noteref-4-33">33</a>] That it swept away the
      restrictions imposed by the existing machinery is true; neither
      ecclesiastical courts, nor High Commission, nor Star Chamber, could
      function after 1640. But, if it broke the discipline of the Church of Laud
      and the State of Strafford, it did so but as a step towards erecting a
      more rigorous discipline of its own. It would have been scandalized by
      economic individualism as much as by religious tolerance, and the broad
      outlines of its scheme of organization favored unrestricted liberty in
      matters of business as little as in the things of the spirit. To the
      Puritan of any period in the century between the accession of Elizabeth
      and the Civil War, the suggestion that he was the friend of economic or
      social license would have seemed as wildly inappropriate as it would have
      appeared to most of his critics, who taunted him, except in the single
      matter of usury, with an intolerable meticulousness.</p>
      <p>A godly discipline was, indeed, the very ark of the Puritan covenant.
      Delivered in thunder to the Moses of Geneva, its vital necessity had been
      the theme of the Joshuas of Scotland, England and France. Knox produced a
      Scottish edition of it; Cartwright, Travers and Udall composed treatises
      expounding it. Bancroft exposed its perils for the established
      ecclesiastical order.[<a href="#footnote-4-34" id="noteref-4-34">34</a>]
      The word “discipline” implied essentially “a directory of Church
      government,” established in order that “the wicked may be corrected with
      ecclesiastical censures, according to the quality of the fault”;[<a
      href="#footnote-4-35" id="noteref-4-35">35</a>] and the proceedings of
      Puritan
      <i lang="la">classes</i> in the sixteenth century show that the conception
      of a rule of life, to be enforced by the pressure of the common
      conscience, and in the last resort by spiritual penalties, was a vital
      part of their system. When, at the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign,<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span> the sectaries in London
      described their objects as not merely the “free and pure” preaching of the
      Gospel, nor the pure ministration of the sacraments, but “to have, not the
      fylthye cannon lawe, but disciplyne onelye and altogether agreeable to the
      same heavenlye and Allmightye word of our good Lorde Jesus Chryste,”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-36" id="noteref-4-36">36</a>] the antithesis suggests
      that something more than verbal instruction is intended. Bancroft noted
      that it was the practice, when a sin was committed by one of the faithful,
      for the elders to apply first admonishment and then excommunication. The
      minute-book of one of the few <i lang="la">classes</i> whose records
      survive confirms his statement.[<a href="#footnote-4-37"
      id="noteref-4-37">37</a>]</p>
      <p>All this early movement had almost flickered out before the end of the
      sixteenth century. But the conception lay at the very root of
      Presbyterianism, and it reëmerged in the system of church government which
      the supercilious Scotch Commissioners at the Westminster Assembly steered
      to inconclusive victory, between Erastians on the right and Independents
      on the left. The destruction of the Court of High Commission, of the
      temporal jurisdiction of all persons in Holy Orders, and finally, with the
      abolition of episcopacy, of the ecclesiastical courts themselves, left a
      vacuum. “Mr. Henderson,” wrote the insufferable Baillie, “has ready now a
      short treatise, much called for, of our church discipline.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-38" id="noteref-4-38">38</a>] In June 1646 an
      unenthusiastic Parliament accepted the ordinance which, after a three
      years’ debate of intolerable tedium, emerged from the Assembly’s Committee
      on the Discipline and Government of the Church, and which provided for the
      suspension by the elders of persons guilty of scandalous offences.
      Detested by the Independents and cold-shouldered by Parliament, which had
      no intention of admitting the divine right of presbyteries, the system
      never took deep root, and in London, at least, there appears to be no
      evidence of any exercise of jurisdiction by elders or <i
      lang="la">classes</i>. In parts of Lancashire, on the<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> other hand, it seems to have been actively
      at work, down, at any rate, to 1649. The change in the political
      situation, in particular the triumph of the army, prevented it, Mr. Shaw
      thinks, from functioning longer.[<a href="#footnote-4-39"
      id="noteref-4-39">39</a>]</p>
      <p>“Discipline” included all questions of moral conduct, and of these, in
      an age when a great mass of economic relations were not the almost
      automatic reactions of an impersonal mechanism, but a matter of human
      kindliness or meanness between neighbors in village or borough, economic
      conduct was naturally part. Calvin and Beza, perpetuating with a new
      intensity the medieval idea of a Church-civilization, had sought to make
      Geneva a pattern, not only of doctrinal purity, but of social
      righteousness and commercial morality. Those who had drunk from their
      spring continued, in even less promising environments, the same tradition.
      Bucer, who wrote when something more fundamental than a politician’s
      reformation seemed possible to enthusiasts with their eyes on Geneva, had
      urged the reconstruction of every side of the economic life of a society
      which was to be Church and State in one.[<a href="#footnote-4-40"
      id="noteref-4-40">40</a>] English Puritanism, while accepting after some
      hesitation Calvin’s much qualified condonation of moderate interest, did
      not intend in other respects to countenance a laxity welcome only to
      worldlings. Knewstub appealed to the teaching of “that worthy instrument
      of God, Mr. Calvin,” to prove that the habitual usurer ought to be “thrust
      out of the society of men.” Smith embroidered the same theme. Baro, whose
      Puritanism lost him his professorship, denounced the “usual practice
      amongst rich men, and some of the greater sort, who by lending, or by
      giving out their money to usury, are wont to snare and oppress the poor
      and needier sort.” Cartwright, the most famous leader of Elizabethan
      Puritanism, described usury as “a hainous offence against God and his
      Church,” and laid down that the offender should be excluded from the
      sacraments until he satisfied the congregation of his penitence.<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>[<a href="#footnote-4-41"
      id="noteref-4-41">41</a>] The ideal of all was that expressed in the
      apostolic injunction to be content with a modest competence and to shun
      the allurements of riches. “Every Christian man is bound in conscience
      before God,” wrote Stubbes, “to provide for his household and family, but
      yet so as his immoderate care surpasse not the bands, nor yet transcend
      the limits, of true Godlynes.... So farre from covetousnes and from
      immoderate care would the Lord have us, that we ought not this day to care
      for tomorrow, for (saith he) sufficient to the day is the travail of the
      same.”[<a href="#footnote-4-42" id="noteref-4-42">42</a>]</p>
      <p>The most influential work on social ethics written in the first half of
      the seventeenth century from the Puritan standpoint was Ames’ <i
      lang="la">De Conscientia</i>, a manual of Christian conduct which was
      intended to supply the brethren with the practical guidance which had been
      offered in the Middle Ages by such works as <i lang="la">Dives et
      Pauper</i>. It became a standard authority, quoted again and again by
      subsequent writers. Forbidden to preach by the bishop of London, Ames
      spent more than twenty years in Holland, where he held a chair of theology
      at the University of Franeker, and his experience of social life in the
      country which was then the business capital of Europe makes the
      remorseless rigor of his social doctrine the more remarkable. He accepts,
      as in his day was inevitable, the impossibility of distinguishing between
      interest on capital invested in business, and interest on capital invested
      in land, since men put money indifferently into both, and, like Calvin, he
      denies that interest is forbidden in principle by Scripture or natural
      reason. But, like Calvin, he surrounds his indulgence with qualifications;
      he requires that no interest shall be charged on loans to the needy, and
      describes as the ideal investment for Christians one in which the lender
      shares risks with the borrower, and demands only “a fair share of the
      profits, according to the degree in which God has blessed him by whom the
      money is used.” His teaching with regard to prices is not less
      conservative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> “To wish
      to buy cheap and to sell dear is common (as Augustine observes), but it is
      a common vice.” Men must not sell above the maximum fixed by public
      authority, though they may sell below it, since it is fixed to protect the
      buyer; when there is no legal maximum, they must follow the market price
      and “the judgment of prudent and good men.” They must not take advantage
      of the necessities of individual buyers, must not overpraise their wares,
      must not sell them dearer merely because they have cost them much to
      get.[<a href="#footnote-4-43" id="noteref-4-43">43</a>] Puritan utterances
      on the subject of enclosing were equally trenchant.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-44" id="noteref-4-44">44</a>]</p>
      <p>Nor was such teaching merely the pious pedantry of the pulpit. It found
      some echo in contrite spirits; it left some imprint on the conduct of
      congregations. If D’Ewes was the unresisting victim of a more than
      ordinarily aggressive conscience, he was also a man of the world who
      played a not inconspicuous part in public affairs; and D’Ewes not only
      ascribed the fire which destroyed his father’s house to the judgment of
      Heaven on ill-gotten gains, but expressly prescribed in his will that, in
      order to avoid the taint of the accursed thing, provision should be made
      for his daughters, not by investing his capital at a fixed—and therefore
      usurious—rate of interest, but by the purchase either of land or of
      annuities.[<a href="#footnote-4-45" id="noteref-4-45">45</a>] The <i
      lang="la">classis</i> which met at Dedham in the eighties of the sixteenth
      century was concerned partly with questions of ceremony, of church
      government, of the right use of Sunday, and with the weighty problems
      whether boys of sixteen might wear their hats in church, and by what marks
      one might detect a witch. But it discussed also what provision could be
      made to check vagrancy; advised the brethren to confine their dealings to
      “the godliest of that trade” (of cloth making); recommended the
      establishment in the township of a scheme of universal education, that of
      children of parents too poor to meet the cost being defrayed from
      collections made in church; and urged that each well-to-do<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> householder should provide
      in his home for two (or, if less able, one) of his impoverished neighbors
      who “walke christianly and honestlie in their callinges.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-46" id="noteref-4-46">46</a>] In the ever-lengthening
      list of scandalous and notorious sins to be punished by exclusion from the
      sacrament, which was elaborated by the Westminster Assembly, a place was
      found, not only for drunkards, swearers, and blasphemers, worshippers and
      makers of images, senders or carriers of challenges, persons dancing,
      gaming, attending plays on the Lord’s day, or resorting to witches,
      wizards, and fortune-tellers, but for the more vulgar vices of those who
      fell into extortion, barratry and bribery.[<a href="#footnote-4-47"
      id="noteref-4-47">47</a>] The <i lang="la">classis</i> of Bury in
      Lancashire (<i lang="la">quantum mutatus!</i>) took these economic lapses
      seriously. It decided in 1647, after considerable debate, that “usury is a
      scandalous sin, deserving suspention upon obstinacy.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-48" id="noteref-4-48">48</a>]</p>
      <p>It was a moment when good men were agog to cast the money-changers from
      the temple and to make straight the way of the Lord. “God hath honnored
      you in callinge you to a place of power and trust, and hee expects that
      you should bee faithfull to that trust. You are postinge to the grave
      every day; you dwell uppon the borders of eternity; your breath is in your
      nostrells; therfore duble and treble your resolutions to bee zealous in a
      good thinge.... How dreadfull will a dieinge bed bee to a negligent
      magistrate! What is the reward of a slothfull servant? Is it not to bee
      punished with everlastinge destruction from the presence of the Lord?”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-49" id="noteref-4-49">49</a>] Such, in that singular
      age, was the language in which the mayor of Salisbury requested the
      justices of Wiltshire to close four public-houses. Apparently they closed
      them.</p>
      <p>The attempt to crystallize social morality in an objective discipline
      was possible only in a theocracy; and, still eloquent in speech, theocracy
      had abdicated in fact, even before the sons of Belial returned to cut down
      its groves and lay waste its holy places. In an age when the right to
      dissent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span> from the State
      Church was still not fully established, its defeat was fortunate, for it
      was the victory of tolerance. It meant, however, that the discipline of
      the Church gave place to the attempt to promote reform through the action
      of the State, which reached its height in the Barebones Parliament.
      Projects for law reform, marriage reform and financial reform, the reform
      of prisons and the relief of debtors, jostled each other on its
      committees; while outside it there were murmurs among radicals against
      social and economic privilege, which were not to be heard again till the
      days of the Chartists, and which to the conservative mind of Cromwell
      seemed to portend mere anarchy. The transition from the idea of a moral
      code enforced by the Church, which had been characteristic of early
      Calvinism, to the economic individualism of the later Puritan movement
      took place, in fact, by way of the democratic agitation of the
      Independents. Abhorring the whole mechanism of ecclesiastical discipline
      and compulsory conformity, they endeavored to achieve the same social and
      ethical ends by political action.</p>
      <p>The change was momentous. If the English Social Democratic movement has
      any single source, that source is to be found in the New Model Army. But
      the conception implied in the attempt to formulate a scheme of economic
      ethics—the theory that every department of life falls beneath the same
      all-encompassing arch of religion—was too deeply rooted to be exorcised
      merely by political changes, or even by the more corroding march of
      economic development. Expelled from the world of fact, where it had always
      been a stranger and a sojourner, it survived in the world of ideas, and
      its champions in the last half of the century labored it the more,
      precisely because they knew that it must be conveyed to their audiences by
      teaching and preaching or not at all. Of those champions the most learned,
      the most practical, and the most persuasive was Richard Baxter.</p>
      <p>How Baxter endeavored to give practical instruction to<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
      his congregation at Kidderminster, he himself has told us. “Every Thursday
      evening my neighbours that were most desirous and had opportunity met at
      my house, and there one of them repeated the sermon, and afterwards they
      proposed what doubts any of them had about the sermon, or any other case
      of conscience, and I resolved their doubts.”[<a href="#footnote-4-50"
      id="noteref-4-50">50</a>] Both in form and in matter, his
      <i>Christian Directory, or a Summ of Practical Theologie and Cases of
      Conscience</i>[<a href="#footnote-4-51" id="noteref-4-51">51</a>] is a
      remarkable book. It is, in essence, a Puritan <i lang="la">Summa
      Theologica</i> and <i lang="la">Summa Moralis</i> in one; its method of
      treatment descends directly from that of the medieval <i
      lang="la">Summæ</i>, and it is, perhaps, the last important English
      specimen of a famous <i lang="la">genus</i>. Its object, as Baxter
      explains in his introduction, is “the resolving of practical cases of
      conscience, and the reducing of theoretical knowledge into serious
      Christian practice.” Divided into four parts, Ethics, Economics,
      Ecclesiastics, and Politics, it has as its purpose to establish the rules
      of a Christian casuistry, which may be sufficiently detailed and precise
      to afford practical guidance to the proper conduct of men in the different
      relations of life, as lawyer, physician, schoolmaster, soldier, master and
      servant, buyer and seller, landlord and tenant, lender and borrower, ruler
      and subject. Part of its material is derived from the treatment of similar
      questions by previous writers, both before and after the Reformation, and
      Baxter is conscious of continuing a great tradition. But it is, above all
      things, realistic, and its method lends plausibility to the suggestion
      that it originated in an attempt to answer practical questions put to its
      author by members of his congregation. Its aim is not to overwhelm by
      authority, but to convince by an appeal to the enlightened common sense of
      the Christian reader. It does not overlook, therefore, the practical facts
      of a world in which commerce is carried on by the East India Company in
      distant markets, trade is universally conducted on credit, the iron
      manufacture is a large-scale industry demanding<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span> abundant supplies of capital and offering a
      profitable opening to the judicious investor, and the relations of
      landlords and tenants have been thrown into confusion by the fire of
      London. Nor does it ignore the moral qualities for the cultivation of
      which an opportunity is offered by the life of business. It takes as its
      starting-point the commercial environment of the Restoration, and its
      teaching is designed for “Rome or London, not Fools’ Paradise.”</p>
      <p>Baxter’s acceptance of the realities of his age makes the content of
      his teaching the more impressive. The attempt to formulate a casuistry of
      economic conduct obviously implies that economic relations are to be
      regarded merely as one department of human behavior, for which each man is
      morally responsible, not as the result of an impersonal mechanism, to
      which ethical judgments are irrelevant. Baxter declines, therefore, to
      admit the convenient dualism, which exonerates the individual by
      representing his actions as the outcome of uncontrollable forces. The
      Christian, he insists, is committed by his faith to the acceptance of
      certain ethical standards, and these standards are as obligatory in the
      sphere of economic transactions as in any other province of human
      activity. To the conventional objection that religion has nothing to do
      with business—that “every man will get as much as he can have and that <i
      lang="la">caveat emptor</i> is the only security”—he answers bluntly that
      this way of dealing does not hold among Christians. Whatever the laxity of
      the law, the Christian is bound to consider first the golden rule and the
      public good. Naturally, therefore, he is debarred from making money at the
      expense of other persons, and certain profitable avenues of commerce are
      closed to him at the outset. “It is not lawful to take up or keep up any
      oppressing monopoly or trade, which tends to enrich you by the loss of the
      Commonwealth or of many.”</p>
      <p>But the Christian must not only eschew the obvious extortion practiced
      by the monopolist, the engrosser, the organizer<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span> of a corner or a combine. He must carry on
      his business in the spirit of one who is conducting a public service; he
      must order it for the advantage of his neighbor as much as, and, if his
      neighbor be poor, more than, for his own. He must not desire “to get
      another’s goods or labour for less than it is worth.” He must not secure a
      good price for his own wares “by extortion working upon men’s ignorance,
      error, or necessity.” When prices are fixed by law, he must strictly
      observe the legal maximum; when they are not, he must follow the price
      fixed by common estimation. If he finds a buyer who is willing to give
      more, he “must not make too great an advantage of his convenience or
      desire, but be glad that [he] can pleasure him upon equal, fair, and
      honest terms,” for “it is a false rule of them that think their commodity
      is worth as much as any one will give.” If the seller foresees that in the
      future prices are likely to fall, he must not make profit out of his
      neighbour’s ignorance, but must tell him so. If he foresees that they will
      rise, he may hold his wares back, but only—a somewhat embarrassing
      exception—if it be not “to the hurt of the Commonwealth, as if ... keeping
      it in be the cause of the dearth, and ... bringing it forth would help to
      prevent it.” If he is buying from the poor, “charity must be exercised as
      well as justice”; the buyer must pay the full price that the goods are
      worth to himself, and, rather than let the seller suffer because he cannot
      stand out for his price, should offer him a loan or persuade some one else
      to do so. In no case may a man doctor his wares in order to get for them a
      higher price than they are really worth, and in no case may he conceal any
      defects of quality; if he was so unlucky as to have bought an inferior
      article, he “may not repair [his] loss by doing as [he] was done by, ...
      no more than [he] may cut another’s purse because [his] was cut.” Rivalry
      in trade, Baxter thinks, is inevitable. But the Christian must not snatch
      a good bargain “out of greedy covetousness,<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> nor to the injury of the poor ... nor ... so
      as to disturb that due and civil order which should be among moderate men
      in trading.” On the contrary, if “a covetous oppressor” offer a poor man
      less than his goods are worth, “it may be a duty to offer the poor man the
      worth of his commodity and save him from the oppressor.”</p>
      <p>The principles which should determine the contract between buyer and
      seller are applied equally to all other economic relations. Usury, in the
      sense of payment for a loan, is not in itself unlawful for Christians. But
      it becomes so, when the lender does not allow the borrower “such a
      proportion of the gain as his labour, hazard, or poverty doth require, but
      ... will live at ease upon his labours”; or when, in spite of the
      borrower’s misfortune, he rigorously exacts his pound of flesh; or when
      interest is demanded for a loan which charity would require to be free.
      Masters must discipline their servants for their good; but it is “an
      odious oppression and injustice to defraud a servant or labourer of his
      wages, yea, or to give him less than he deserveth.” As the descendant of a
      family of yeomen, “free,” as he says, “from the temptations of poverty and
      riches,”[<a href="#footnote-4-52" id="noteref-4-52">52</a>] Baxter had
      naturally strong views as to the ethics of landowning. Significantly
      enough, he deals with them under the general rubric of “Cases of
      oppression, especially of tenants,” oppression being defined as the
      “injuring of inferiors who are unable to resist or to right themselves.”
      “It is too common a sort of oppression for the rich in all places to
      domineer too insolently over the poor, and force them to follow their
      wills and to serve their interest, be it right or wrong.... Especially
      unmerciful landlords are the common and sore oppressors of the countrymen.
      If a few men can but get money enough to purchase all the land in a
      county, they think that they may do with their own as they list, and set
      such hard bargains of it to their tenants, that they are all but as their
      servants.... An oppressor is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg
      224]</span> Anti-Christ and an Anti-God ... not only the agent of the
      Devil, but his image.” As in his discussion of prices, the gist of
      Baxter’s analysis of the cases of conscience which arise in the relations
      of landlord and tenant is that no man may secure pecuniary gain for
      himself by injuring his neighbor. Except in unusual circumstances, a
      landlord must not let his land at the full competitive rent which it would
      fetch in the market: “Ordinarily the common sort of tenants in England
      should have so much abated of the fullest worth that they may comfortably
      live on it, and follow their labours with cheerfulness of mind and liberty
      to serve God in their families, and to mind the matters of their
      salvation, and not to be necessitated to such toil and care and pinching
      want as shall make them liker slaves than free men.” He must not improve
      (i.e., enclose) his land without considering the effect on the tenants, or
      evict his tenants without compensating them, and in such a way as to cause
      depopulation; nor must a newcomer take a holding over the sitting tenant’s
      head by offering “a greater rent than he can give or than the landlord
      hath just cause to require of him.” The Christian, in short, while
      eschewing “causeless, perplexing, melancholy scruples, which would stop a
      man in the course of his duty,” must so manage his business as to “avoid
      sin rather than loss,” and seek first to keep his conscience in peace.</p>
      <p>The first characteristic to strike the modern reader in all this
      teaching is its conservatism. In spite of the economic and political
      revolutions of the past two centuries, how small, after all, the change in
      the presentation of the social ethics of the Christian faith! A few months
      after the appearance of the
      <i>Christian Directory</i>, the Stop of the Exchequer tore a hole in the
      already intricate web of London finance, and sent a shiver through the
      money-markets of Europe. But Baxter, though no mere antiquarian,
      discourses of equity in bargaining, of just prices, of reasonable<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> rents, of the sin of usury,
      in the same tone, if not with quite the same conclusions, as a medieval
      Schoolman, and he differs from one of the later Doctors, like <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr>
      Antonino, hardly more than <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antonino himself
      had differed from Aquinas. Seven years later Bunyan published <i>The Life
      and Death of Mr. Badman</i>. Among the vices which it pilloried were the
      sin of extortion, “most commonly committed by men of trade, who without
      all conscience, when they have an advantage, will make a prey of their
      neighbour,” the covetousness of “hucksters, that buy up the poor man’s
      victual wholesale and sell it to him again for unreasonable gains,” the
      avarice of usurers, who watch till “the poor fall into their mouths,” and
      “of those vile wretches called pawnbrokers, that lend money and goods to
      poor people, who are by necessity forced to such an inconvenience, and
      will make by one trick or another the interest of what they so lend amount
      to thirty and forty, yea, sometimes fifty pounds by the year.” As
      Christian and Christiana watched Mr. Badman thus bite and pinch the poor
      in his shop in Bedford, before they took staff and scrip for their journey
      to a more distant City, they remembered that the Lord himself will plead
      the cause of the afflicted against them that oppress them, and reflected,
      taught by the dealings of Ephron the son of Zohar, and of David with Ormon
      the Jebusite, that there is a “wickedness, as in selling too dear, so in
      buying too cheap.”[<a href="#footnote-4-53" id="noteref-4-53">53</a>]
      Brother Berthold of Regensburg had said the same four centuries before in
      his racy sermons in Germany. The emergence of the idea that “business is
      business,” and that the world of commercial transactions is a closed
      compartment with laws of its own, if more ancient than is often supposed,
      did not win so painless a triumph as is sometimes suggested. Puritan as
      well as Catholic accepted without demur the view which set all human
      interests and activities within the compass of religion. Puritans, as
      well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> as Catholics,
      essayed the formidable task of formulating a Christian casuistry of
      economic conduct.</p>
      <p>They essayed it. But they succeeded even less than the Popes and
      Doctors whose teaching, not always unwittingly, they repeated. And their
      failure had its roots, not merely in the obstacles offered by the ever
      more recalcitrant opposition of a commercial environment, but, like all
      failures which are significant, in the soul of Puritanism itself. Virtues
      are often conquered by vices, but their rout is most complete when it is
      inflicted by other virtues, more militant, more efficient, or more
      congenial, and it is not only tares which choke the ground where the good
      seed is sown. The fundamental question, after all, is not what kind of
      rules a faith enjoins, but what type of character it esteems and
      cultivates. To the scheme of Christian ethics which offered admonitions
      against the numberless disguises assumed by the sin which sticketh fast
      between buying and selling, the Puritan character offered, not direct
      opposition, but a polished surface on which these ghostly admonitions
      could find no enduring foothold. The rules of Christian morality
      elaborated by Baxter were subtle and sincere. But they were like seeds
      carried by birds from a distant and fertile plain, and dropped upon a
      glacier. They were at once embalmed and sterilized in a river of ice.</p>
      <p>“The capitalist spirit” is as old as history, and was not, as has
      sometimes been said, the offspring of Puritanism. But it found in certain
      aspects of later Puritanism a tonic which braced its energies and
      fortified its already vigorous temper. At first sight, no contrast could
      be more violent than that between the iron collectivism, the almost
      military discipline, the remorseless and violent rigors practiced in
      Calvin’s Geneva, and preached elsewhere, if in a milder form, by his
      disciples, and the impatient rejection of all traditional restrictions on
      economic enterprise which was the temper of the English business world
      after the Civil War.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> In
      reality, the same ingredients were present throughout, but they were mixed
      in changing proportions, and exposed to different temperatures at
      different times. Like traits of individual character which are suppressed
      till the approach of maturity releases them, the tendencies in Puritanism,
      which were to make it later a potent ally of the movement against the
      control of economic relations in the name either of social morality or of
      the public interest, did not reveal themselves till political and economic
      changes had prepared a congenial environment for their growth. Nor, once
      those conditions were created, was it only England which witnessed the
      transformation. In all countries alike, in Holland, in America, in
      Scotland, in Geneva itself, the social theory of Calvinism went through
      the same process of development. It had begun by being the very soul of
      authoritarian regimentation. It ended by being the vehicle of an almost
      Utilitarian individualism. While social reformers in the sixteenth century
      could praise Calvin for his economic rigor, their successors in
      Restoration England, if of one persuasion, denounced him as the parent of
      economic license, if of another, applauded Calvinist communities for their
      commercial enterprise and for their freedom from antiquated prejudices on
      the subject of economic morality. So little do those who shoot the arrows
      of the spirit know where they will light.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-4-3"><abbr title="3">III</abbr>. THE TRIUMPH OF THE
      ECONOMIC VIRTUES</h3>
      <p>“One beam in a dark place,” wrote one who knew the travail of the
      spirit, “hath exceeding much refreshment in it. Blessed be His name for
      shining upon so dark a heart as mine.”[<a href="#footnote-4-54"
      id="noteref-4-54">54</a>] While the revelation of God to the individual
      soul is the center of all religion, the essence of Puritan theology was
      that it made it, not only the center, but the whole circumference and
      substance, dismissing as dross and vanity all else but this secret and
      solitary communion. Grace alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg
      228]</span> can save, and this grace is the direct gift of God, unmediated
      by any earthly institution. The elect cannot by any act of their own evoke
      it; but they can prepare their hearts to receive it, and cherish it when
      received. They will prepare them best, if they empty them of all that may
      disturb the intentness of their lonely vigil. Like an engineer, who, to
      canalize the rush of the oncoming tide, dams all channels save that
      through which it is to pour, like a painter who makes light visible by
      plunging all that is not light in gloom, the Puritan attunes his heart to
      the voice from Heaven by an immense effort of concentration and
      abnegation. To win all, he renounces all. When earthly props have been
      cast down, the soul stands erect in the presence of God. Infinity is
      attained by a process of subtraction.</p>
      <p>To a vision thus absorbed in a single intense experience, not only
      religious and ecclesiastical systems, but the entire world of human
      relations, the whole fabric of social institutions, witnessing in all the
      wealth of their idealism and their greed to the infinite creativeness of
      man, reveal themselves in a new and wintry light. The fire of the spirit
      burns brightly on the hearth; but through the windows of his soul the
      Puritan, unless a poet or a saint, looks on a landscape touched by no
      breath of spring. What he sees is a forbidding and frost-bound wilderness,
      rolling its snow-clad leagues towards the grave—a wilderness to be subdued
      with aching limbs beneath solitary stars. Through it he must take his way,
      alone. No aid can avail him: no preacher, for only the elect can apprehend
      with the spirit the word of God; no Church, for to the visible Church even
      reprobates belong; no sacrament, for sacraments are ordained to increase
      the glory of God, not to minister spiritual nourishment to man; hardly God
      himself, for Christ died for the elect, and it may well be that the
      majesty of the Creator is revealed by the eternal damnation of all but a
      remnant of the created.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg

      <p>His life is that of a soldier in hostile territory. He suffers in
      spirit the perils which the first settlers in America endured in body, the
      sea behind, the untamed desert in front, a cloud of inhuman enemies on
      either hand. Where Catholic and Anglican had caught a glimpse of the
      invisible, hovering like a consecration over the gross world of sense, and
      touching its muddy vesture with the unearthly gleam of a divine, yet
      familiar, beauty, the Puritan mourned for a lost Paradise and a creation
      sunk in sin. Where they had seen society as a mystical body, compact of
      members varying in order and degree, but dignified by participation in the
      common life of Christendom, he saw a bleak antithesis between the spirit
      which quickeneth and an alien, indifferent or hostile world. Where they
      had reverenced the decent order whereby past was knit to present, and man
      to man, and man to God, through fellowship in works of charity, in
      festival and fast, in the prayers and ceremonies of the Church, he turned
      with horror from the filthy rags of human righteousness. Where they, in
      short, had found comfort in a sacrament, he started back from a snare set
      to entrap his soul.</p>

      <p>Those who seek God in isolation from their fellowmen, unless trebly
      armed for the perils of the quest, are apt to find, not God, but a devil,
      whose countenance bears an embarrassing resemblance to their own. The
      moral self-sufficiency of the Puritan nerved his will, but it corroded his
      sense of social solidarity. For, if each individual’s destiny hangs on a
      private transaction between himself and his Maker, what room is left for
      human intervention? A servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg
      230]</span> of Jehovah more than of Christ, he revered God as a Judge
      rather than loved him as a Father, and was moved less by compassion for
      his erring brethren than by impatient indignation at the blindness of
      vessels of wrath who “sinned their mercies.” A spiritual aristocrat, who
      sacrificed fraternity to liberty, he drew from his idealization of
      personal responsibility a theory of individual rights, which, secularized
      and generalized, was to be among the most potent explosives that the world
      has known. He drew from it also a scale of ethical values, in which the
      traditional scheme of Christian virtues was almost exactly reversed, and
      which, since he was above all things practical, he carried as a dynamic
      into the routine of business and political life.</p>
      <p>For, since conduct and action, though availing nothing to attain the
      free gift of salvation, are a proof that the gift has been accorded, what
      is rejected as a means is resumed as a consequence, and the Puritan flings
      himself into practical activities with the dæmonic energy of one who, all
      doubts allayed, is conscious that he is a sealed and chosen vessel. Once
      engaged in affairs, he brings to them both the qualities and limitations
      of his creed in all their remorseless logic. Called by God to labor in his
      vineyard, he has within himself a principle at once of energy and of
      order, which makes him irresistible both in war and in the struggles of
      commerce. Convinced that character is all and circumstances nothing, he
      sees in the poverty of those who fall by the way, not a misfortune to be
      pitied and relieved, but a moral failing to be condemned, and in riches,
      not an object of suspicion—though like other gifts they may be abused—but
      the blessing which rewards the triumph of energy and will. Tempered by
      self-examination, self-discipline, self-control, he is the practical
      ascetic, whose victories are won not in the cloister, but on the
      battlefield, in the counting-house, and in the market.</p>
      <p>This temper, of course with infinite varieties of quality<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span> and emphasis, found its
      social organ in those middle and commercial classes who were the citadel
      of the Puritan spirit, and whom, “ennobled by their own industry and
      virtue,”[<a href="#footnote-4-56" id="noteref-4-56">56</a>] Milton
      described as the standard-bearers of progress and enlightenment. We are so
      accustomed to think of England as <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> the
      pioneer of economic progress, that we are apt to forget how recently that
      rôle has been assumed. In the Middle Ages it belonged to the Italians, in
      the sixteenth century to the Netherland dominions of the Spanish Empire,
      in the seventeenth to the United Provinces and, above all, to the
      Dutch.</p>
      <p>The England of Shakespeare and Bacon was still largely medieval in its
      economic organization and social outlook, more interested in maintaining
      customary standards of consumption than in accumulating capital for future
      production, with an aristocracy contemptuous of the economic virtues, a
      peasantry farming for subsistence amid the organized confusion of the
      open-field village, and a small, if growing, body of jealously
      conservative craftsmen. In such a society Puritanism worked like the yeast
      which sets the whole mass fermenting. It went through its slack and
      loosely knit texture like a troop of Cromwell’s Ironsides through the
      disorderly cavalry of Rupert. Where, as in Ireland, the elements were so
      alien that assimilation was out of the question, the result was a wound
      that festered for three centuries. In England the effect was that at once
      of an irritant and of a tonic. Puritanism had its own standards of social
      conduct, derived partly from the obvious interests of the commercial
      classes, partly from its conception of the nature of God and the destiny
      of man. These standards were in sharp antithesis, both to the considerable
      surviving elements of feudalism in English society, and to the policy of
      the authoritarian State, with its ideal of an ordered and graded society,
      whose different members were to be maintained in their traditional status
      by the pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span> and
      protection of a paternal monarchy. Sapping the former by its influence and
      overthrowing the latter by direct attack, Puritanism became a potent force
      in preparing the way for the commercial civilization which finally
      triumphed at the Revolution.</p>
      <p>The complaint that religious radicalism, which aimed at upsetting the
      government of the Church, went hand in hand with an economic radicalism,
      which resented the restraints on individual self-interest imposed in the
      name of religion or of social policy, was being made by the stricter
      school of religious opinion quite early in the reign of Elizabeth.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-57" id="noteref-4-57">57</a>] Seventeenth-century
      writers repeated the charge that the Puritan conscience lost its delicacy
      where matters of business were concerned, and some of them were
      sufficiently struck by the phenomenon to attempt an historical explanation
      of it. The example on which they usually seized—the symbol of a supposed
      general disposition to laxity—was the indulgence shown by Puritan divines
      in the particular matter of moderate interest. It was the effect, so the
      picturesque story ran,[<a href="#footnote-4-58" id="noteref-4-58">58</a>]
      of the Marian persecution. The refugees who fled to the Continent could
      not start business in a foreign country. If, driven by necessity, they
      invested their capital and lived on the proceeds, who could quarrel with
      so venial a lapse in so good a cause? Subsequent writers embellished the
      picture. The redistribution of property at the time of the Dissolution,
      and the expansion of trade in the middle of the century, had led, one of
      them argued, to a great increase in the volume of credit transactions. The
      opprobrium which attached to loans at interest—“a sly and forbid
      practice”—not only among Romanists and Anglicans, but among honest
      Puritans, played into the hands of the less scrupulous members of “the
      faction.” Disappointed in politics, they took to money-lending, and,
      without venturing to justify usury in theory, defended it in practice.
      “Without the scandal of a recantation, they contrived<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span> an expedient, by maintaining that, though
      usury for the name were stark naught, yet for widows, orphans and other
      impotents (therein principally comprising the saints under persecution) it
      was very tolerable, because profitable, and in a manner necessary.”
      Naturally, Calvin’s doctrine as to the legitimacy of moderate interest was
      hailed by these hypocrites with a shout of glee. “It took with the
      brethren like polygamy with the Turks, recommended by the example of
      divers zealous ministers, who themselves desired to pass for orphans of
      the first rank.”[<a href="#footnote-4-59" id="noteref-4-59">59</a>] Nor
      was it only as the apologist of moderate interest that Puritanism was
      alleged to reveal the cloven hoof. Puritans themselves complained of a
      mercilessness in driving hard bargains, and of a harshness to the poor,
      which contrasted unfavorably with the practice of followers of the
      unreformed religion. “The Papists,” wrote a Puritan in 1653, “may rise up
      against many of this generation. It is a sad thing that they should be
      more forward upon a bad principle than a Christian upon a good one.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-60" id="noteref-4-60">60</a>]</p>
      <p>Such, in all ages, is history as seen by the political pamphleteer. The
      real story was less dramatic, but more significant. From the very
      beginning, Calvinism had comprised two elements, which Calvin himself had
      fused, but which contained the seeds of future discord. It had at once
      given a whole-hearted <i lang="fr">imprimatur</i> to the life of business
      enterprise, which most earlier moralists had regarded with suspicion, and
      had laid upon it the restraining hand of an inquisitorial discipline. At
      Geneva, where Calvinism was the creed of a small and homogeneous city, the
      second aspect had predominated; in the many-sided life of England, where
      there were numerous conflicting interests to balance it, and where it was
      long politically weak, the first. Then, in the late sixteenth and early
      seventeenth centuries, had come the wave of commercial and financial
      expansion—companies, colonies, capitalism in textiles, capitalism in<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span> mining, capitalism in
      finance—on the crest of which the English commercial classes, in Calvin’s
      day still held in leading-strings by conservative statesmen, had climbed
      to a position of dignity and affluence.</p>
      <p>Naturally, as the Puritan movement came to its own, these two elements
      flew apart. The collectivist, half-communistic aspect, which had never
      been acclimatized in England, quietly dropped out of notice, to crop up
      once more, and for the last time, to the disgust and terror of merchant
      and landowner, in the popular agitation under the Commonwealth. The
      individualism congenial to the world of business became the distinctive
      characteristic of a Puritanism which had arrived, and which, in becoming a
      political force, was at once secularized and committed to a career of
      compromise. Its note was not the attempt to establish on earth a “Kingdom
      of Christ,” but an ideal of personal character and conduct, to be realized
      by the punctual discharge both of public and private duties. Its theory
      had been discipline; its practical result was liberty.</p>
      <p>Given the social and political conditions of England, the
      transformation was inevitable. The incompatibility of Presbyterianism with
      the stratified arrangement of English society had been remarked by
      Hooker.[<a href="#footnote-4-61" id="noteref-4-61">61</a>] If the City
      Fathers of Geneva had thrown off by the beginning of the seventeenth
      century the religious collectivism of Calvin’s régime, it was not to be
      expected that the landowners and <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> of an
      aristocratic and increasingly commercial nation, however much Calvinist
      theology might appeal to them, would view with favor the social doctrines
      implied in Calvinist discipline. In the reign of the first two Stuarts,
      both economic interests and political theory pulled them hard in the
      opposite direction. “Merchants’ doings,” the man of business in Wilson’s
      <i>Discourse upon Usury</i> had observed, “must not thus be overthwarted
      by preachers and others that cannot skill of their dealings.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-62" id="noteref-4-62">62</a>] Behind the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> elaborate façade of Tudor
      State control, which has attracted the attention of historians, an
      individualist movement had been steadily developing, which found
      expression in opposition to the traditional policy of stereotyping
      economic relations by checking enclosure, controlling food supplies and
      prices, interfering with the money-market, and regulating the conditions
      of the wage contract and of apprenticeship. In the first forty years of
      the seventeenth century, on grounds both of expediency and of principle,
      the commercial and propertied classes were becoming increasingly restive
      under the whole system, at once ambitious and inefficient, of economic
      paternalism. It was in the same sections of the community that both
      religious and economic dissatisfaction were most acute. Puritanism, with
      its idealization of the spiritual energies which found expression in the
      activities of business and industry, drew the isolated rivulets of
      discontent together, and swept them forward with the dignity and momentum
      of a religious and a social philosophy.</p>
      <p>For it was not merely as the exponent of certain tenets as to theology
      and church government, but as the champion of interests and opinions
      embracing every side of the life of society, that the Puritan movement
      came into collision with the Crown. In reality, as is the case with most
      heroic ideologies, the social and religious aspects of Puritanism were not
      disentangled; they presented themselves, both to supporters and opponents,
      as different facets of a single scheme. “All that crossed the views of the
      needy courtiers, the proud encroaching priests, the thievish projectors,
      the lewd nobility and gentry ... whoever could endure a sermon, modest
      habit or conversation, or anything good—all these were Puritans.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-63" id="noteref-4-63">63</a>] The clash was not one of
      theories—a systematic and theoretical individualism did not develop till
      after the Restoration—but of contradictory economic interests and
      incompatible conceptions of social expediency.</p>
      <p>The economic policy haltingly pursued by the Government<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> of Charles <abbr title="the
      first">I</abbr> bore some resemblance to the system of which a more
      uncompromising version was developed between 1661 and 1685 by Colbert in
      France. It was one which favored an artificial and State-promoted
      capitalism—a capitalism resting on the grant of privileges and concessions
      to company promoters who would pay for them, and accompanied by an
      elaborate system of State control, which again, if partly inspired by a
      genuine solicitude for the public interest, was too often smeared with an
      odious trail of finance. It found its characteristic expression in the
      grant of patents, in the revival of the royal monopoly of exchange
      business, against which the City had fought under Elizabeth, in attempts
      to enforce by administrative action compliance with the elaborate and
      impracticable code controlling the textile trades and to put down
      speculation in foodstuffs, and in raids on enclosing landlords, on
      employers who paid in truck or evaded the rates fixed by assessment, and
      on justices who were negligent in the administration of the Poor Laws.
      Such measures were combined with occasional plunges into even more
      grandiose schemes for the establishment of county granaries, for taking
      certain industries into the hands of the Crown, and even for the virtual
      nationalization of the cloth manufacture.[<a href="#footnote-4-64"
      id="noteref-4-64">64</a>]</p>
      <p>“The very genius of that nation of people,” wrote Strafford to Laud of
      the Puritans, “leads them always to oppose, as well civilly as
      ecclesiastically, all that ever authority ordains for them.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-65" id="noteref-4-65">65</a>] Against this whole attempt
      to convert economic activity into an instrument of profit for the
      Government and its hangers-on—against, no less, the spasmodic attempts of
      the State to protect peasants against landlords, craftsmen against
      merchants, and consumers against middlemen—the interests which it thwarted
      and curbed revolted with increasing pertinacity. Questions of taxation, on
      which attention has usually been concentrated, were in reality merely one
      element in a quarrel which had its deeper<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span> cause in the collision of incompatible
      social philosophies. The Puritan tradesman had seen his business ruined by
      a monopoly granted to a needy courtier, and cursed Laud and his Popish
      soap. The Puritan goldsmith or financier had found his trade as a
      bullion-broker hampered by the reëstablishment of the ancient office of
      Royal Exchanger, and secured a resolution from the House of Commons,
      declaring that the patent vesting it in Lord Holland and the proclamation
      forbidding the exchanging of gold and silver by unauthorized persons were
      a grievance. The Puritan money-lender had been punished by the Court of
      High Commission, and railed at the interference of bishops in temporal
      affairs. The Puritan clothier, who had suffered many things at the hands
      of interfering busy-bodies despatched from Whitehall to teach him his
      business, averted discreet eyes when the Wiltshire workmen threw a more
      than usually obnoxious Royal Commissioner into the Avon, and, when the
      Civil War came, rallied to the Parliament. The Puritan country gentleman
      had been harried by Depopulation Commissions, and took his revenge with
      the meeting of the Long Parliament. The Puritan merchant had seen the
      Crown both squeeze money out of his company, and threaten its monopoly by
      encouraging courtly interlopers to infringe its charter. The Puritan
      member of Parliament had invested in colonial enterprises, and had ideas
      as to commercial policy which were not those of the Government. Confident
      in their own energy and acumen, proud of their success, and regarding with
      profound distrust the interference both of Church and of State with
      matters of business and property rights, the commercial classes, in spite
      of their attachment to a militant mercantilism in matters of trade, were,
      even before the Civil War, more than half converted to the administrative
      nihilism which was to be the rule of social policy in the century
      following it. Their demand was the one which is usual in such
      circumstances.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span> It was
      that business affairs should be left to be settled by business men,
      unhampered by the intrusions of an antiquated morality or by misconceived
      arguments of public policy.[<a href="#footnote-4-66"
      id="noteref-4-66">66</a>]</p>
      <p>The separation of economic from ethical interests, which was the note
      of all this movement, was in sharp opposition to religious tradition, and
      it did not establish itself without a struggle. Even in the very capital
      of European commerce and finance, an embittered controversy was occasioned
      by the refusal to admit usurers to communion or to confer degrees upon
      them; it was only after a storm of pamphleteering, in which the
      theological faculty of the University of Utrecht performed prodigies of
      zeal and ingenuity, that the States of Holland and West Friesland closed
      the agitation by declaring that the Church had no concern with questions
      of banking.[<a href="#footnote-4-67" id="noteref-4-67">67</a>] In the
      French Calvinist Churches, the decline of discipline had caused
      lamentations a generation earlier.[<a href="#footnote-4-68"
      id="noteref-4-68">68</a>] In America, the theocracy of Massachusetts,
      merciless alike to religious liberty and to economic license, was about to
      be undermined by the rise of new States like Rhode Island and
      Pennsylvania, whose tolerant, individualist and utilitarian temper was
      destined to find its greatest representative in the golden common sense of
      Benjamin Franklin.[<a href="#footnote-4-69" id="noteref-4-69">69</a>] “The
      sin of our too great fondness for trade, to the neglecting of our more
      valuable interests,” wrote a Scottish divine in 1709, when Glasgow was on
      the eve of a triumphant outburst of commercial enterprise, “I humbly think
      will be written upon our judgment.... I am sure the Lord is remarkably
      frowning upon our trade ... since it was put in the room of religion.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-70" id="noteref-4-70">70</a>]</p>
      <p>In England, the growing disposition to apply exclusively economic
      standards to social relations evoked from Puritan writers and divines
      vigorous protests against usurious interest, extortionate prices and the
      oppression of tenants by landlords. The faithful, it was urged, had
      interpreted only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span> too
      literally the doctrine that the sinner was saved, not by works, but by
      faith. Usury, “in time of Popery an odious thing,”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-71" id="noteref-4-71">71</a>] had become a scandal.
      Professors, by their covetousness, caused the enemies of the reformed
      religion to blaspheme.[<a href="#footnote-4-72" id="noteref-4-72">72</a>]
      The exactions of the forestaller and regrater were never so monstrous or
      so immune from interference. The hearts of the rich were never so hard,
      nor the necessities of the poor so neglected. “The poor able to work are
      suffered to beg; the impotent, aged and sick are not sufficiently provided
      for, but almost starved with the allowance of 3<i><abbr
      title="pence">d.</abbr></i> and 4<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> a
      piece a week.... These are the last times indeed. Men generally are all
      for themselves. And some would set up such, having a form of religion,
      without the power of it.”[<a href="#footnote-4-73"
      id="noteref-4-73">73</a>]</p>
      <p>These utterances came, however, from that part of the Puritan mind
      which looked backward. That which looked forward found in the rapidly
      growing spirit of economic enterprise something not uncongenial to its own
      temper, and went out to welcome it as an ally. What in Calvin had been a
      qualified concession to practical exigencies appeared in some of his later
      followers as a frank idealization of the life of the trader, as the
      service of God and the training-ground of the soul. Discarding the
      suspicion of economic motives, which had been as characteristic of the
      reformers as of medieval theologians, Puritanism in its later phases added
      a halo of ethical sanctification to the appeal of economic expediency, and
      offered a moral creed, in which the duties of religion and the calls of
      business ended their long estrangement in an unanticipated reconciliation.
      Its spokesmen pointed out, it is true, the peril to the soul involved in a
      single-minded concentration on economic interests. The enemy, however, was
      not riches, but the bad habits sometimes associated with them, and its
      warnings against an excessive preoccupation with the pursuit of gain wore
      more and more the air of after-thoughts, appended to teaching the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span> main tendency and emphasis
      of which were little affected by these incidental qualifications. It
      insisted, in short, that money-making, if not free from spiritual dangers,
      was not a danger and nothing else, but that it could be, and ought to be,
      carried on for the greater glory of God.</p>
      <p>The conception to which it appealed to bridge the gulf sprang from the
      very heart of Puritan theology. It was that expressed in the
      characteristic and oft-used phrase, “a Calling.”[<a href="#footnote-4-74"
      id="noteref-4-74">74</a>] The rational order of the universe is the work
      of God, and its plan requires that the individual should labor for God’s
      glory. There is a spiritual calling, and a temporal calling. It is the
      first duty of the Christian to know and believe in God; it is by faith
      that he will be saved. But faith is not a mere profession, such as that of
      Talkative of Prating Row, whose “religion is to make a noise.” The only
      genuine faith is the faith which produces works. “At the day of Doom men
      shall be judged according to their fruits. It will not be said then, Did
      you believe? but, Were you doers, or talkers only?”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-75" id="noteref-4-75">75</a>] The second duty of the
      Christian is to labor in the affairs of practical life, and this second
      duty is subordinate only to the first. “God,” wrote a Puritan divine,
      “doth call every man and woman ... to serve him in some peculiar
      employment in this world, both for their own and the common good.... The
      Great Governour of the world hath appointed to every man his proper post
      and province, and let him be never so active out of his sphere, he will be
      at a great loss, if he do not keep his own vineyard and mind his own
      business.”[<a href="#footnote-4-76" id="noteref-4-76">76</a>]</p>
      <p>From this reiterated insistence on secular obligations as imposed by
      the divine will, it follows that, not withdrawal from the world, but the
      conscientious discharge of the duties of business, is among the loftiest
      of religious and moral virtues. “The begging friars and such monks as live
      only to themselves and to their formal devotion, but do employ themselves
      in no one thing to further their own subsistence<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span> or the good of mankind ... yet have the
      confidence to boast of this their course as a state of perfection; which
      in very deed, as to the worthiness of it, falls short of the poorest
      cobbler, for his is a calling of God, and theirs is none.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-77" id="noteref-4-77">77</a>] The idea was not a new
      one. Luther had advanced it as a weapon against monasticism. But for
      Luther, with his patriarchal outlook on economic affairs, the calling
      means normally that state of life in which the individual has been set by
      Heaven, and against which it is impiety to rebel. On the lips of Puritan
      divines, it is not an invitation to resignation, but the bugle-call which
      summons the elect to the long battle which will end only with their death.
      “The world is all before them.” They are to hammer out their salvation,
      not merely <i lang="la">in vocatione</i>, but <i lang="la">per
      vocationem</i>. The calling is not a condition in which the individual is
      born, but a strenuous and exacting enterprise, to be undertaken, indeed,
      under the guidance of Providence, but to be chosen by each man for
      himself, with a deep sense of his solemn responsibilities. “God hath given
      to man reason for this use, that he should first consider, then choose,
      then put in execution; and it is a preposterous and brutish thing to fix
      or fall upon any weighty business, such as a calling or condition of life,
      without a careful pondering it in the balance of sound reason.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-78" id="noteref-4-78">78</a>]</p> 
      <p><i lang="la">Laborare est orare.</i> By the Puritan moralist the
      ancient maxim is repeated with a new and intenser significance. The labor
      which he idealizes is not simply a requirement imposed by nature, or a
      punishment for the sin of Adam. It is itself a kind of ascetic discipline,
      more rigorous than that demanded of any order of mendicants—a discipline
      imposed by the will of God, and to be undergone, not in solitude, but in
      the punctual discharge of secular duties. It is not merely an economic
      means, to be laid aside when physical needs have been satisfied. It is a
      spiritual end, for in it alone can the soul find health, and it must be
      continued as an ethical duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg
      242]</span> long after it has ceased to be a material necessity. Work thus
      conceived stands at the very opposite pole from “good works,” as they were
      understood, or misunderstood, by Protestants. They, it was thought, had
      been a series of single transactions, performed as compensation for
      particular sins, or out of anxiety to acquire merit. What is required of
      the Puritan is not individual meritorious acts, but a holy life—a system
      in which every element is grouped round a central idea, the service of
      God, from which all disturbing irrelevances have been pruned, and to which
      all minor interests are subordinated.</p>
      <p>His conception of that life was expressed in the words, “Be wholly
      taken up in diligent business of your lawful callings, when you are not
      exercised in the more immediate service of God.”[<a href="#footnote-4-79"
      id="noteref-4-79">79</a>] In order to deepen his spiritual life, the
      Christian must be prepared to narrow it. He “is blind in no man’s cause,
      but best sighted in his own. He confines himself to the circle of his own
      affairs and thrusts not his fingers in needless fires.... He sees the
      falseness of it [the world] and therefore learns to trust himself ever,
      others so far as not to be damaged by their disappointment.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-80" id="noteref-4-80">80</a>] There must be no idle
      leisure: “those that are prodigal of their time despise their own
      souls.”[<a href="#footnote-4-81" id="noteref-4-81">81</a>] Religion must
      be active, not merely contemplative. Contemplation is, indeed, a kind of
      self-indulgence. “To neglect this [i.e., bodily employment and mental
      labor] and say, ‘I will pray and meditate,’ is as if your servant should
      refuse your greatest work, and tye himself to some lesser, easie part....
      God hath commanded you some way or other to labour for your daily
      bread.”[<a href="#footnote-4-82" id="noteref-4-82">82</a>] The rich are no
      more excused from work than the poor, though they may rightly use their
      riches to select some occupation specially serviceable to others.
      Covetousness is a danger to the soul, but it is not so grave a danger as
      sloth. “The standing pool is prone to putrefaction: and it were better to
      beat down the body and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg
      243]</span> keep it in subjection by a laborious calling, than through
      luxury to become a cast-away.”[<a href="#footnote-4-83"
      id="noteref-4-83">83</a>] So far from poverty being meritorious, it is a
      duty to choose the more profitable occupation. “If God show you a way in
      which you may lawfully get more than in another way (without wrong to your
      soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful
      way, you cross one of the ends of your Calling, and you refuse to be God’s
      steward.” Luxury, unrestrained pleasure, personal extravagance, can have
      no place in a Christian’s conduct, for “every penny which is laid out ...
      must be done as by God’s own appointment.” Even excessive devotion to
      friends and relations is to be avoided. “It is an irrational act, and
      therefore not fit for a rational creature, to love any one farther than
      reason will allow us.... It very often taketh up men’s minds so as to
      hinder their love to God.”[<a href="#footnote-4-84"
      id="noteref-4-84">84</a>] The Christian life, in short, must be systematic
      and organized, the work of an iron will and a cool intelligence. Those who
      have read Mill’s account of his father must have been struck by the extent
      to which Utilitarianism was not merely a political doctrine, but a moral
      attitude. Some of the links in the Utilitarian coat of mail were forged,
      it may be suggested, by the Puritan divines of the seventeenth
      century.</p>
      <p>The practical application of these generalities to business is set out
      in the numerous works composed to expound the rules of Christian conduct
      in the varied relations of life. If one may judge by their
      titles—<i>Navigation Spiritualized</i>, <i>Husbandry Spiritualized</i>,
      <i>The Religious Weaver</i>[<a href="#footnote-4-85"
      id="noteref-4-85">85</a>]—there must have been a considerable demand for
      books conducive to professional edification. A characteristic specimen is
      <i>The Tradesman’s Calling</i>,[<a href="#footnote-4-86"
      id="noteref-4-86">86</a>] by Richard Steele. The author, after being
      deprived of a country living under the Act of Uniformity, spent his
      declining years as minister of a congregation at Armourers Hall in London,
      and may be presumed to have understood the spiritual requirements of<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span> the City in his day, when
      the heroic age of Puritanism was almost over and enthusiasm was no longer
      a virtue. No one who was writing a treatise on economic ethics today would
      address himself primarily to the independent shopkeeper, as the figure
      most representative of the business community, and Steele’s book throws a
      flood of light on the problems and outlook of the <i
      lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, in an age before the center of economic gravity
      had shifted from the substantial tradesman to the exporting merchant, the
      industrial capitalist and the financier.</p>
      <p>Like Baxter, he is acquainted with the teaching of earlier authorities
      as to equity in bargaining. He is doubtful, however, of its practical
      utility. Obvious frauds in matters of quality and weight are to be
      avoided; an honest tradesman ought not to corner the market, or
      “accumulate two or three callings merely to increase his riches,” or
      oppress the poor; nor should he seek more than “a reasonable proportion of
      gain,” or “lie on the catch to make [his] markets of others’ straits.” But
      Steele rejects as useless in practice the various objective standards of a
      reasonable profit—cost of production, standard of life, customary
      prices—which had been suggested in earlier ages, and concludes that the
      individual must judge for himself. “Here, as in many other cases, an
      upright conscience must be the clerk of the market.”</p>
      <p>In reality, however, the characteristic of <i>The Tradesman’s
      Calling</i>, as of the age in which it was written, is not the relics of
      medieval doctrine which linger embalmed in its guileless pages, but the
      robust common sense, which carries the author lightly over traditional
      scruples on a tide of genial, if Philistine, optimism. For his main thesis
      is a comfortable one—that there is no necessary conflict between religion
      and business. “Prudence and Piety were always very good friends.... You
      may gain enough of both worlds if you would mind each in its place.” His
      object is to show how that agreeable result may be produced by
      dedicating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
      business—with due reservations—to the service of God, and he has naturally
      little to say on the moral casuistry of economic conduct, because he is
      permeated by the idea that trade itself is a kind of religion. A
      tradesman’s first duty is to get a full insight into his calling, and to
      use his brains to improve it. “He that hath lent you talents hath also
      said, ‘Occupy till I come!’ Your strength is a talent, your parts are
      talents, and so is your time. How is it that ye stand all the day idle?...
      Your trade is your proper province.... Your own vineyard you should
      keep.... Your fancies, your understandings, your memories ... are all to
      be laid out therein.” So far from their being an inevitable collision
      between the requirements of business and the claims of religion, they walk
      hand in hand. By a fortunate dispensation, the virtues enjoined on
      Christians—diligence, moderation, sobriety, thrift—are the very qualities
      most conducive to commercial success. The foundation of all is prudence;
      and prudence is merely another name for the “godly wisdom [which] comes in
      and puts due bounds” to his expenses, “and teaches the tradesman to live
      rather somewhat below than at all above his income.” Industry comes next,
      and industry is at once expedient and meritorious. It will keep the
      tradesman from “frequent and needless frequenting of taverns,” and pin him
      to his shop, “where you may most confidently expect the presence and
      blessing of God.”</p>
      <p>If virtue is advantageous, vice is ruinous. Bad company, speculation,
      gambling, politics, and “a preposterous zeal” in religion—it is these
      things which are the ruin of tradesmen. Not, indeed, that religion is to
      be neglected. On the contrary, it “is to be exercised in the frequent use
      of holy ejaculations.” What is deprecated is merely the unbusinesslike
      habit of “neglecting a man’s necessary affairs upon pretence of religious
      worship.” But these faults, common and uncommon alike, are precisely those
      to be avoided by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
      sincere Christian, who must not, indeed, deceive or oppress his neighbor,
      but need not fly to the other extreme, be righteous over-much, or refuse
      to “take the advantage which the Providence of God puts into his hands.”
      By a kind of happy, preëstablished harmony, such as a later age discovered
      between the needs of society and the self-interest of the individual,
      success in business is in itself almost a sign of spiritual grace, for it
      is a proof that a man has labored faithfully in his vocation, and that
      “God has blessed his trade.” “Nothing will pass in any man’s account
      except it be done in the way of his calling.... Next to the saving his
      soul, [the tradesman’s] care and business is to serve God in his calling,
      and to drive it as far as it will go.”</p>
      <p>When duty was so profitable, might not profit-making be a duty? Thus
      argued the honest pupils of Mr. Gripeman, the schoolmaster of Love-gain, a
      market-town in the county of Coveting in the north.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-87" id="noteref-4-87">87</a>] The inference was
      illogical, but how attractive! When the Rev. David Jones was so indiscreet
      as to preach at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Woolnoth in Lombard
      Street a sermon against usury on the text, “The Pharisees who were
      covetous heard all these things and they derided Christ,” his career in
      London was brought to an abrupt conclusion.[<a href="#footnote-4-88"
      id="noteref-4-88">88</a>]</p>
      <p>The springs of economic conduct lie in regions rarely penetrated by
      moralists, and to suggest a direct reaction of theory on practice would be
      paradoxical. But, if the circumstances which determine that certain kinds
      of conduct shall be profitable are economic, those which decide that they
      shall be the object of general approval are primarily moral and
      intellectual. For conventions to be adopted with whole-hearted enthusiasm,
      to be not merely tolerated, but applauded, to become the habit of a nation
      and the admiration of its philosophers, the second condition must be
      present as well as the first. The insistence among men of pecuniary
      motives, the strength of economic egotism, the appetite for<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> gain—these are the
      commonplaces of every age and need no emphasis. What is significant is the
      change of standards which converted a natural frailty into a resounding
      virtue. After all, it appears, a man can serve two masters, for—so happily
      is the world disposed—he may be paid by one, while he works for the other.
      Between the old-fashioned denunciation of uncharitable covetousness and
      the new-fashioned applause of economic enterprise, a bridge is thrown by
      the argument which urges that enterprise itself is the discharge of a duty
      imposed by God.</p>
      <p>In the year 1690 appeared a pamphlet entitled <i>A Discourse of Trade,
      by N. B., M.D.</i>[<a href="#footnote-4-89" id="noteref-4-89">89</a>]
      Notable for its enlightened discussion of conventional theories of the
      balance of trade, it is a good specimen of an indifferent <i
      lang="la">genus</i>. But its authorship was more significant than its
      argument. For N. B. was Dr. Nicholas Barbon; and Dr. Nicholas Barbon,
      currency expert, pioneer of insurance, and enthusiast for land-banks, was
      the son of that Praise-God Barebones, by the parody of whose alluring
      surname a cynical posterity recorded its verdict on the brief comedy of
      the Rule of the Saints over Laodicean Englishmen. The reaction from
      Puritan rigor to Restoration license is the most familiar of platitudes.
      The reaction to a mundane materialism was more gradual, more general, and
      ultimately of greater significance. The profligacy of the courtier had its
      decorous counterpart in the economic orgies of the tradesman and the
      merchant. Votaries, not of Bacchus, but of a more exacting and more
      profitable divinity, they celebrated their relief at the discredit of a
      too arduous idealism, by plunging with redoubled zest into the agreeable
      fever of making and losing money.</p>
      <p>The transition from the anabaptist to the company promoter was less
      abrupt than might at first sight be supposed. It had been prepared,
      however unintentionally, by Puritan moralists. In their emphasis on the
      moral duty of untiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
      activity, on work as an end in itself, on the evils of luxury and
      extravagance, on foresight and thrift, on moderation and self-discipline
      and rational calculation, they had created an ideal of Christian conduct,
      which canonized as an ethical principle the efficiency which economic
      theorists were preaching as a specific for social disorders. It was as
      captivating as it was novel. To countless generations of religious
      thinkers, the fundamental maxim of Christian social ethics had seemed to
      be expressed in the words of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul to
      Timothy: “Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. For the
      love of money is the root of all evil.” Now, while, as always, the world
      battered at the gate, a new standard was raised within the citadel by its
      own defenders. The garrison had discovered that the invading host of
      economic appetites was, not an enemy, but an ally. Not sufficiency to the
      needs of daily life, but limitless increase and expansion, became the goal
      of the Christian’s efforts. Not consumption, on which the eyes of earlier
      sages had been turned, but production, became the pivot of his argument.
      Not an easy-going and open-handed charity, but a systematic and methodical
      accumulation, won the meed of praise that belongs to the good and faithful
      servant. The shrewd, calculating commercialism which tries all human
      relations by pecuniary standards, the acquisitiveness which cannot rest
      while there are competitors to be conquered or profits to be won, the love
      of social power and hunger for economic gain—these irrepressible appetites
      had evoked from time immemorial the warnings and denunciations of saints
      and sages. Plunged in the cleansing waters of later Puritanism, the
      qualities which less enlightened ages had denounced as social vices
      emerged as economic virtues. They emerged as moral virtues as well. For
      the world exists not to be enjoyed, but to be conquered. Only its
      conqueror deserves the name of Christian. For such a philosophy, the
      question, “What shall it profit a man?” carries<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span> no sting. In winning the world, he wins the
      salvation of his own soul as well.</p>
      <p>The idea of economic progress as an end to be consciously sought, while
      ever receding, had been unfamiliar to most earlier generations of
      Englishmen, in which the theme of moralists had been the danger of
      unbridled cupidity, and the main aim of public policy had been the
      stability of traditional relationships. It found a new sanction in the
      identification of labor and enterprise with the service of God. The
      magnificent energy which changed in a century the face of material
      civilization was to draw nourishment from that temper. The worship of
      production and ever greater production—the slavish drudgery of the
      millionaire and his unhappy servants—was to be hallowed by the precepts of
      the same compelling creed.</p>
      <p>Social development moves with a logic whose inferences are long
      delayed, and the day of these remoter applications had not yet dawned. The
      version of Christian ethics expounded by Puritanism in some of its later
      phases was still only in its vigorous youth. But it sailed forward on a
      flowing tide. It had an unconscious ally in the preoccupation with
      economic interests which found expression in the enthusiasm of business
      politicians for a commercial <i lang="de">Machtpolitik</i>. The youthful
      Commonwealth, a rival of Holland “for the fairest mistress in the
      world—trade,”[<a href="#footnote-4-90" id="noteref-4-90">90</a>] was not
      two years old when it made its own essay in economic imperialism. “A
      bare-faced war” for commerce, got up by the Royal African Company, was
      Clarendon’s verdict[<a href="#footnote-4-91" id="noteref-4-91">91</a>] on
      the Dutch war of 1665-7. Five years later, Shaftesbury hounded the City
      against Holland with the cry of <i lang="la">Delenda est Carthago</i>. The
      war finance of the Protectorate had made it necessary for Cromwell to
      court Dutch and Jewish, as well as native, capitalists, and the
      impecunious Government of the Restoration was in the hands of those
      syndicates of goldsmiths whose rapacity the Chancellor, a survivor<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span> from the age before the
      deluge, when aristocrats still despised the upstart plutocracy, found not
      a little disgusting.[<a href="#footnote-4-92"
      id="noteref-4-92">92</a>]</p>
      <p>The contemporary progress of economic thought fortified no less the
      mood which glorified the economic virtues. Economic science developed in
      England, not, as in Germany, as the handmaid of public administration,
      nor, as in France, through the speculations of philosophers and men of
      letters, but as the interpreter of the practical interests of the City.
      With the exception of Petty and Locke, its most eminent practitioners were
      business men, and the questions which excited them were those, neither of
      production nor of social organization, but of commerce and finance—the
      balance of trade, tariffs, interest, currency and credit. The rise of
      Political Arithmetic after the Restoration, profoundly influenced, as it
      was, by the Cartesian philosophy and by the progress of natural science,
      stamped their spontaneous and doctrineless individualism with the seal of
      theoretical orthodoxy. “Knowledge,” wrote the author of the preface to a
      work by one of the most eminent exponents of the new science, “in great
      measure is become mechanical.”[<a href="#footnote-4-93"
      id="noteref-4-93">93</a>] The exact analysis of natural conditions, the
      calculations of forces and strains, the reduction of the complex to the
      operation of simple, constant and measurable forces, was the natural bias
      of an age interested primarily in mathematics and physics. Its object was
      “to express itself in terms of number, weight or measure, to use only
      arguments of sense, and to consider only such causes as have visible
      foundations in nature; leaving those that depend upon the mutable minds,
      opinions, appetites and passions of particular men to the consideration of
      others.”[<a href="#footnote-4-94" id="noteref-4-94">94</a>]</p>
      <p>In such an atmosphere, the moral casuistry, which had occupied so large
      a place in the earlier treatment of social and economic subjects, seemed
      the voice of an antiquated superstition. Moreover, the main economic dogma
      of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> mercantilist had
      an affinity with the main ethical dogma of the Puritan, which was the more
      striking because the coincidence was undesigned. To the former,
      production, not consumption, was the pivot of the economic system, and, by
      what seems to the modern reader a curious perversion, consumption is
      applauded only because it offers a new market for productive energies. To
      the latter, the cardinal virtues are precisely those which find in the
      strenuous toils of industry and commerce their most natural expression.
      The typical qualities of the successful business life, in the days before
      the rise of joint-stock enterprise, were intensity and earnestness of
      labor, concentration, system and method, the initiative which broke with
      routine and the foresight which postponed the present to the future.
      Advice like that of the Reverend Mr. Steele to his City congregation was
      admirably calculated to give these arduous excellences a heightened status
      and justification. The lean goddess, Abstinence, whom Mr. Keynes, in a
      passage of brilliant indiscretion, has revealed as the tutelary divinity
      of Victorian England, was inducted to the austere splendors of her ascetic
      shrine by the pious hands of Puritan moralists.</p>
      <p>Such teaching fell upon willing ears. Excluded by legislation from a
      direct participation in public affairs, Dissenters of means and social
      position threw themselves into the alternative career offered by commerce
      and finance, and did so the more readily because religion itself had
      blessed their choice. If they conformed, the character given them by their
      critics—“opinionating, relying much upon their own judgment ...
      ungrateful, as not holding themselves beholden to any man ... proud, as
      thinking themselves the only favorites of God, and the only wise or
      virtuous among men”[<a href="#footnote-4-95"
      id="noteref-4-95">95</a>]—disposed them to the left in questions of Church
      and State. The names of the commercial magnates of the day lend some
      confirmation to the suggestion of that affinity between religious
      radicalism and business acumen which<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span> envious contemporaries expressed in their
      sneers at the “Presbyterian old usurer,” “devout misers,” and “extorting
      Ishban.”[<a href="#footnote-4-96" id="noteref-4-96">96</a>] The four
      London members elected in 1661 had not only filled the ordinary civic
      offices, but had held between them the governorship of the East India
      Company, the deputy-governorship of the Levant Company, and the
      masterships of the Salters and Drapers Companies; two of them were said to
      be Presbyterians, and two Independents.[<a href="#footnote-4-97"
      id="noteref-4-97">97</a>] Of the committee of leading business men who
      advised Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>’s Government on
      questions of commercial policy, some, like Sir Patience Ward and Michael
      Godfrey, represented the ultra-Protestantism of the City, while others,
      like Thomas Papillon and the two Houblons, were members of the French
      Huguenot church in London.[<a href="#footnote-4-98"
      id="noteref-4-98">98</a>] In spite of the bitter commercial rivalry with
      Holland, both Dutch capital and Dutch ideas found an enthusiastic welcome
      in London.[<a href="#footnote-4-99" id="noteref-4-99">99</a>] Sir George
      Downing, Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>’s envoy at the Hague,
      who endeavored to acclimatize Dutch banking methods in England, and who,
      according to Clarendon, was one of the intriguers who prepared the war of
      1665-7, had been reared in the Puritan severity of Salem and Harvard, and
      had been a preacher in the regiment of Colonel Okey.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-100" id="noteref-4-100">100</a>] Paterson, who supplied
      the idea of a joint-stock banking corporation, which Michael Godfrey
      popularized in the City and Montagu piloted through Parliament, was, like
      the magnificent Law, a Scotch company promoter, who had haunted the Hague
      in the days when it was the home of disconsolate Whigs.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-101" id="noteref-4-101">101</a>] Yarranton, most
      ingenious of projectors, had been an officer in the Parliamentary army,
      and his book was a long sermon on the virtues of the Dutch.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-102" id="noteref-4-102">102</a>] Defoe, who wrote the
      idyll of the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> in his
      <i>Complete English Tradesman</i>, was born of nonconformist parents, and
      was intended for the ministry before, having failed in trade, he took up
      politics and literature.[<a href="#footnote-4-103"
      id="noteref-4-103">103</a>] In his admirable study of the iron industry,
      Mr. Ashton has shown that the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg
      253]</span> eminent iron-masters of the eighteenth century belonged as a
      rule to the Puritan connection.[<a href="#footnote-4-104"
      id="noteref-4-104">104</a>] They had their prototype in the seventeenth
      century in Baxter’s friend, Thomas Foley, “who from almost nothing did get
      about £5,000 per annum or more by iron works.”[<a href="#footnote-4-105"
      id="noteref-4-105">105</a>]</p>
      <p>To such a generation, a creed which transformed the acquisition of
      wealth from a drudgery or a temptation into a moral duty was the milk of
      lions. It was not that religion was expelled from practical life, but that
      religion itself gave it a foundation of granite. In that keen atmosphere
      of economic enterprise, the ethics of the Puritan bore some resemblance to
      those associated later with the name of Smiles. The good Christian was not
      wholly dissimilar from the economic man.</p>
      <h3 id="chapter-4-4"><abbr title="4">IV</abbr>. THE NEW MEDICINE FOR
      POVERTY</h3>
      <p>To applaud certain qualities is by implication to condemn the habits
      and institutions which appear to conflict with them. The recognition
      accorded by Puritan ethics to the economic virtues, in an age when such
      virtues were rarer than they are today, gave a timely stimulus to economic
      efficiency. But it naturally, if unintentionally, modified the traditional
      attitude towards social obligations. For the spontaneous, doctrineless
      individualism, which became the rule of English public life a century
      before the philosophy of it was propounded by Adam Smith, no single cause
      was responsible. But, simultaneously with the obvious movements in the
      world of affairs—the discrediting of the ideal of a paternal,
      authoritarian Government, the breakdown of central control over local
      administration, the dislocation caused by the Civil War, the expansion of
      trade and the shifting of industry from its accustomed seats—it is perhaps
      not fanciful to detect in the ethics of Puritanism one<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> force contributing to the
      change in social policy which is noticeable after the middle of the
      century.</p>
      <p>The loftiest teaching cannot escape from its own shadow. To urge that
      the Christian life must be lived in a zealous discharge of private
      duties—how necessary! Yet how readily perverted to the suggestion that
      there are no vital social obligations beyond and above them! To insist
      that the individual is responsible, that no man can save his brother, that
      the essence of religion is the contact of the soul with its Maker, how
      true and indispensable! But how easy to slip from that truth into the
      suggestion that society is without responsibility, that no man can help
      his brother, that the social order and its consequences are not even the
      scaffolding by which men may climb to greater heights, but something
      external, alien and irrelevant—something, at best, indifferent to the life
      of the spirit, and, at worse, the sphere of the letter which killeth and
      of the reliance on works which ensnares the soul into the slumber of
      death! In emphasizing that God’s Kingdom is not of this world, Puritanism
      did not always escape the suggestion that this world is no part of God’s
      Kingdom. The complacent victim of that false antithesis between the social
      mechanism and the life of the spirit, which was to tyrannize over English
      religious thought for the next two centuries, it enthroned religion in the
      privacy of the individual soul, not without some sighs of sober
      satisfaction at its abdication from society. Professor Dicey has commented
      on the manner in which “the appeal of the Evangelicals to personal
      religion corresponds with the appeal of Benthamite Liberals to individual
      energy.”[<a href="#footnote-4-106" id="noteref-4-106">106</a>] The same
      affinity between religious and social interests found an even clearer
      expression in the Puritan movement of the seventeenth century.
      Individualism in religion led insensibly, if not quite logically, to an
      individualist morality, and an individualist morality to a disparagement
      of the significance of the social fabric as compared with personal
      character.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>
      <p>A practical example of that change of emphasis is given by the
      treatment accorded to the questions of Enclosure and of Pauperism. For a
      century and a half the progress of enclosing had been a burning issue,
      flaring up, from time to time, into acute agitation. During the greater
      part of that period, from Latimer in the thirties of the sixteenth century
      to Laud in the thirties of the seventeenth, the attitude of religious
      teachers had been one of condemnation. Sermon after sermon and pamphlet
      after pamphlet—not to mention Statutes and Royal Commissions—had been
      launched against depopulation. The appeal had been, not merely to public
      policy, but to religion. Peasant and lord, in their different degrees, are
      members of one Christian commonwealth, within which the law of charity
      must bridle the corroding appetite for economic gain. In such a mystical
      corporation, knit together by mutual obligations, no man may press his
      advantage to the full, for no man may seek to live “outside the body of
      the Church.”</p>
      <p>Sabotaged by the unpaid magistracy of country gentlemen, who had been
      the obstructive agents of local administration, the practical application
      of such doctrines had always been intermittent, and, when the Long
      Parliament struck the weapon of administrative law from the hands of the
      Crown, it had ceased altogether. But the politics of Westminster were not
      those of village and borough. The events which seemed to aristocratic
      Parliamentarians to close the revolution seemed to the left wing of the
      victorious army only to begin it. In that earliest and most turbulent of
      English democracies, where buff-coat taught scripture politics to his
      general, the talk was not merely of political, but of social,
      reconstruction. The program of the Levellers, who more than any other
      party could claim to express the aspirations of the unprivileged classes,
      included a demand, not only for annual or biennial Parliaments, manhood
      suffrage, a redistribution of seats in proportion to population, and the
      abolition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> veto
      of the House of Lords, but also that “you would have laid open all
      enclosures of fens and other commons, or have them enclosed only or
      chiefly for the benefit of the poor.”[<a href="#footnote-4-107"
      id="noteref-4-107">107</a>] Theoretical communism, repudiated by the
      leading Levellers, found its expression in the agitation of the Diggers,
      on whose behalf Winstanley argued that, “seeing the common people of
      England, by joynt consent of person and purse, have caste out Charles, our
      Norman oppressour ... the land now is to returne into the joynt hands of
      those who have conquered, that is the commonours,” and that the victory
      over the King was incomplete, as long as “wee ... remayne slaves still to
      the kingly power in the hands of lords of manors.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-108" id="noteref-4-108">108</a>]</p>
      <p>Nor was it only from the visionary and the zealot that the pressure for
      redress proceeded. When the shattering of traditional authority seemed for
      a moment to make all things new, local grievances, buried beneath
      centuries of dull oppression, started to life, and in several Midland
      counties the peasants rose to pull down the hated hedges. At Leicester,
      where in 1649 there were rumors of a popular movement to throw down the
      enclosures of the neighboring forest, the City Council took the matter up.
      A petition was drafted, setting out the economic and social evils
      attending enclosure, and proposing the establishment of machinery to check
      it, consisting of a committee without whose assent enclosing was not to be
      permitted. A local minister was instructed to submit the petition to
      Parliament, “which hath still a watchful eye and open ear to redress the
      common grievances of the nation.”[<a href="#footnote-4-109"
      id="noteref-4-109">109</a>] The agent selected to present the city’s case
      was the Rev. John Moore, a prolific pamphleteer, who for several years
      attacked the depopulating landlord with all the fervor of Latimer, though
      with even less than Latimer’s success.</p>
      <p>Half a century before, such commotions would have been followed by the
      passing of Depopulation Acts and the issue<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> of a Royal Commission. But, in the ten years
      since the meeting of the Long Parliament, the whole attitude of public
      policy towards the movement had begun to change. Confiscations,
      compositions and war taxation had effected a revolution in the
      distribution of property, similar, on a smaller scale, to that which had
      taken place at the Reformation. As land changed hands, customary relations
      were shaken and new interests were created. Enclosure, as Moore
      complained,[<a href="#footnote-4-110" id="noteref-4-110">110</a>] was
      being pushed forward by means of law suits ending in Chancery decrees. It
      was not to be expected that City merchants and members of the Committee
      for Compounding, some of whom had found land speculation a profitable
      business, should hear with enthusiasm a proposal to revive the old policy
      of arresting enclosures by State interference, at which the gentry had
      grumbled for more than a century.</p>
      <p>In these circumstances, it is not surprising that reformers should have
      found the open ear of Parliament impenetrably closed to agrarian
      grievances. Nor was it only the political and economic environment which
      had changed. The revolution in thought was equally profound. The
      theoretical basis of the policy of protecting the peasant by preventing
      enclosure had been a conception of landownership which regarded its rights
      and its duties as inextricably interwoven. Property was not merely a
      source of income, but a public function, and its use was limited by social
      obligations and necessities of State. With such a doctrine the classes who
      had taken the lead in the struggle against the monarchy could make no
      truce. Its last vestiges finally disappeared when the Restoration
      Parliament swept away military tenures, and imposed on the nation, in the
      shape of an excise, the financial burden previously borne by
      themselves.</p>
      <p>The theory which took its place, and which was to become in the
      eighteenth century almost a religion, was that<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> expressed by Locke, when he described
      property as a right anterior to the existence of the State, and argued
      that “the supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property
      without his own consent.” But Locke merely poured into a philosophical
      mould ideas which had been hammered out in the stress of political
      struggles, and which were already the commonplace of landowner and
      merchant. The view of society held by that part of the Puritan movement
      which was socially and politically influential had been expressed by
      Ireton and Cromwell in their retort to the democrats in the army. It was
      that only the freeholders really constituted the body politic, and that
      they could use their property as they pleased, uncontrolled by obligations
      to any superior, or by the need of consulting the mass of men, who were
      mere tenants at will, with no fixed interest or share in the land of the
      kingdom.[<a href="#footnote-4-111" id="noteref-4-111">111</a>] Naturally,
      this change of ideas had profound reactions on agrarian policy. Formerly a
      course commending itself to all public-spirited persons, the prevention of
      enclosure was now discredited as the program of a sect of religious and
      political radicals. When Major-General Whalley in 1656 introduced a
      measure to regulate and restrict the enclosure of commons, framed,
      apparently, on the lines proposed by the authorities of Leicester, there
      was an instant outcry from members that it would “destroy property,” and
      the bill was refused a second reading.[<a href="#footnote-4-112"
      id="noteref-4-112">112</a>] After the Restoration the tide began to run
      more strongly in the same direction. Enclosure had already become the
      hobby of the country gentleman. Experts advocated it on economic grounds,
      and legislation to facilitate it was introduced into Parliament. Though
      its technique still remained to be elaborated, the attitude which was to
      be decisive in the eighteenth century had already been crystallized.</p>
      <p>The change of policy was striking. The reason of it was not merely that
      political conditions made the landed gentry<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> omnipotent, and that the Royalist
      squirearchy, who streamed back to their plundered manors in 1660, were in
      no mood to countenance a revival, by the Government of Charles <abbr
      title="the second">II</abbr>, of the administrative interference with the
      rights of property which had infuriated them in the Government of Charles
      <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. It was that opinion as to social policy
      had changed, and changed not least among men of religion themselves. The
      pursuit of economic self-interest, which is the law of nature, is already
      coming to be identified by the pious with the operation of the
      providential plan, which is the law of God. Enclosures will increase the
      output of wool and grain. Each man knows best what his land is suited to
      produce, and the general interest will be best served by leaving him free
      to produce it. “It is an undeniable maxim that every one by the light of
      nature and reason will do that which makes for his greatest advantage....
      The advancement of private persons will be the advantage of the
      public.”[<a href="#footnote-4-113" id="noteref-4-113">113</a>]</p>
      <p>It is significant that such considerations were adduced, not by an
      economist, but by a minister. For the argument was ethical as well as
      economic, and, when Moore appealed to the precepts of traditional morality
      to bridle pecuniary interests, he provoked the retort that a judicious
      attention to pecuniary interests was an essential part of an enlightened
      morality. What the poor need for their spiritual health is—to use the
      favorite catchword of the age—“regulation,” and regulation is possible
      only if they work under the eye of an employer. In the eyes of the austere
      moralists of the Restoration, the first, and most neglected, virtue of the
      poor is industry. Common rights encourage idleness by offering a
      precarious and demoralizing livelihood to men who ought to be at work for
      a master. It is not surprising, therefore, that the admonitions of
      religious teachers against the wickedness of joining house to house and
      field to field should almost entirely cease. Long the typical example of
      uncharitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
      covetousness, enclosure is now considered, not merely economically
      expedient, but morally beneficial. Baxter, with all his
      scrupulousness—partly, perhaps, because of his scrupulousness—differs from
      most earlier divines in giving a qualified approval to enclosure “done in
      moderation by a pious man,” for the characteristic reason that a master
      can establish a moral discipline among his employees, which they would
      miss if they worked for themselves. What matters, in short, is not their
      circumstances, but their character. If they lose as peasants, they will
      gain as Christians. Opportunities for spiritual edification are more
      important than the mere material environment. If only the material
      environment were not itself among the forces determining men’s capacity to
      be edified!</p>
      <p>The temper which deplored that the open-field village was not a school
      of the severer virtues turned on pauperism and poor relief an even more
      shattering criticism. There is no province of social life in which the
      fashioning of a new scale of ethical values on the Puritan anvil is more
      clearly revealed. In the little communities of peasants and craftsmen
      which composed medieval England, all, when Heaven sent a bad harvest, had
      starved together, and the misery of the sick, the orphan and the aged had
      appeared as a personal calamity, not as a social problem. Apart from a few
      precocious theorists, who hinted at the need for a universal and secular
      system of provision for distress, the teaching most characteristic of
      medieval writers had been that the relief of the needy was a primary
      obligation on those who had means. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas,
      who in this matter is typical, quotes with approval the strong words of
      <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ambrose about those who cling to the bread
      of the starving, insists on the idea that property is stewardship, and
      concludes—a conclusion not always drawn from that well-worn phrase—that to
      withhold alms when there is evident and urgent necessity is mortal sin.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-114" id="noteref-4-114">114</a>] Popular feeling had
      lent a half-mystical glamour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg
      261]</span> both to poverty and to the compassion by which poverty was
      relieved, for poor men were God’s friends. At best, the poor were thought
      to represent our Lord in a peculiarly intimate way—“in that sect,” as
      Langland said, “our Saviour saved all mankind”—and it was necessary for
      the author of a religious manual to explain that the rich, as such, were
      not necessarily hateful to God.[<a href="#footnote-4-115"
      id="noteref-4-115">115</a>] At worst, men reflected that the prayers of
      the poor availed much, and that the sinner had been saved from hell by
      throwing a loaf of bread to a beggar, even though a curse went with it.
      The alms bestowed today would be repaid a thousandfold, when the soul took
      its dreadful journey amid rending briars and scorching flames.</p>

      <p>The social character of wealth, which had been the essence of the
      medieval doctrine, was asserted by English divines in the sixteenth
      century with redoubled emphasis, precisely because the growing
      individualism of the age menaced the traditional conception. “The poor
      man,” preached Latimer, “hath title to the rich man’s goods; so that the
      rich man ought to let the poor man have part of his riches to help and to
      comfort him withal.”[<a href="#footnote-4-117" id="noteref-4-117">117</a>]
      Nor had that sovereign indifference to the rigors of the economic calculus
      disappeared, when, under the influence partly of humanitarian
      representatives of the Renaissance like Vives, partly of religious
      reformers, partly of their own ambition to gather all the threads of
      social administration into their own hands, the statesmen of the sixteenth
      century set themselves to organize a secular system of poor relief. In
      England, after three generations in which the attempt was made to stamp
      out vagrancy by police measures of hideous brutality, the momentous
      admission was made that its cause was economic distress, not merely
      personal idleness, and that the whip had no terrors for the man who must
      either tramp or starve. The result was the celebrated Acts imposing a
      compulsory poor-rate and requiring the able-bodied man to be set on work.
      The Privy Council, alert to prevent disorder, drove lethargic justices
      hard, and down to the Civil War the system was administered with fair
      regularity. But the Elizabethan Poor Law was never designed to be what,
      with disastrous results, it became in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
      centuries, the sole measure for coping with economic distress. While it
      provided relief, it was but the last link in a chain of measures—the
      prevention of evictions, the control of food supplies and prices, the
      attempt to stabilize employment and to check unnecessary dismissals of
      workmen—intended to mitigate the forces which made relief necessary. Apart
      from the Poor Law, the first forty years of the<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
      seventeenth century were prolific in the private charity which founded
      alms-houses and hospitals, and established funds to provide employment or
      to aid struggling tradesmen. The appeal was still to religion, which owed
      to poverty a kind of reverence.</p>

      <p>“What, speak you of such things?” said Nicholas Ferrar on his death-bed
      to one who commended his charities. “It would have been but a suitable
      return for me to have given all I had, and not to have scattered a few
      crumbs of alms here and there.”[<a href="#footnote-4-119"
      id="noteref-4-119">119</a>]</p>
      <p>It was inevitable that, in the anarchy of the Civil War, both private
      charity and public relief should fall on evil days. In London, charitable
      endowments seem to have suffered from more than ordinary malversation, and
      there were complaints that the income both of Bridewell and of the
      Hospitals was seriously reduced.[<a href="#footnote-4-120"
      id="noteref-4-120">120</a>] In the country, the records of Quarter
      Sessions paint a picture of confusion, in which the machinery of
      presentment by constables to justices has broken down, and a long wail
      arises, that thieves are multiplied, the poor are neglected, and vagrants
      wander to and fro at their will.[<a href="#footnote-4-121"
      id="noteref-4-121">121</a>] The administrative collapse of the Elizabethan
      Poor Law continued after the Restoration, and twenty-three years later Sir
      Matthew Hale complained that the sections in it relating to the provision
      of employment were a dead letter.[<a href="#footnote-4-122"
      id="noteref-4-122">122</a>] Always unpopular with the local authorities,
      whom they involved in considerable trouble and expense, it is not
      surprising that, with the cessation of pressure by the Central Government,
      they should, except here and there, have been neglected. What is more
      significant, however, than the practical deficiencies in the
      administration of relief, was the rise of a new school of opinion,
      which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> regarded with
      repugnance the whole body of social theory of which both private charity
      and public relief had been the expression.</p>
      <p>“The generall rule of all England,” wrote a pamphleteer in 1646, “is to
      whip and punish the wandring beggars ... and so many justices execute one
      branch of that good Statute (which is the point of justice), but as for
      the point of charitie, they leave [it] undone, which is to provide houses
      and convenient places to set the poore to work.”[<a href="#footnote-4-123"
      id="noteref-4-123">123</a>] The House of Commons appears to have been
      conscious that the complaint had some foundation; in 1649 it ordered that
      the county justices should be required to see that stocks of material were
      provided as the law required,[<a href="#footnote-4-124"
      id="noteref-4-124">124</a>] and the question of preparing new legislation
      to ensure that persons in distress should be found employment was on
      several occasions referred to committees of the House.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-125" id="noteref-4-125">125</a>] Nothing seems, however,
      to have come of these proposals, nor was the Elizabethan policy of
      “setting the poor on work” that which was most congenial to the temper of
      the time. Upon the admission that distress was the result, not of personal
      deficiencies, but of economic causes, with its corollary that its victims
      had a legal right to be maintained by society, the growing individualism
      of the age turned the same frigid scepticism as was later directed against
      the Speenhamland policy by the reformers of 1834. Like the friends of Job,
      it saw in misfortune, not the chastisement of love, but the punishment for
      sin. The result was that, while the penalties on the vagrant were
      redoubled, religious opinion laid less emphasis on the obligation of
      charity than upon the duty of work, and that the admonitions which had
      formerly been turned upon uncharitable covetousness were now directed
      against improvidence and idleness. The characteristic sentiment was that
      of Milton’s friend, Hartlib: “The law of God saith, ‘he that will not
      work, let him not eat.’ This would be a sore scourge and smart whip for
      idle persons if ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
      none should be suffered to eat till they had wrought for it.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-126" id="noteref-4-126">126</a>]</p>
      <p>The new attitude found expression in the rare bursts of public activity
      provoked by the growth of pauperism between 1640 and 1660. The idea of
      dealing with it on sound business principles, by means of a corporation
      which would combine profit with philanthropy, was being sedulously
      preached by a small group of reformers.[<a href="#footnote-4-127"
      id="noteref-4-127">127</a>] Parliament took it up, and in 1649 passed an
      Act for the relief and employment of the poor and the punishment of
      beggars, under which a company was to be established with power to
      apprehend vagrants, to offer them the choice between work and whipping,
      and to set to compulsory labor all other poor persons, including children
      without means of maintenance.[<a href="#footnote-4-128"
      id="noteref-4-128">128</a>] Eight years later the prevalence of vagrancy
      produced an Act of such extreme severity as almost to recall the
      suggestion made a generation later by Fletcher of Saltoun, that vagrants
      should be sent to the galleys. It provided that, since offenders could
      rarely be taken in the act, any vagrant who failed to satisfy the justices
      that he had a good reason for being on the roads should be arrested and
      punished as a sturdy beggar, whether actually begging or not.[<a
      href="#footnote-4-129" id="noteref-4-129">129</a>]</p>
      <p>The protest against indiscriminate almsgiving, as the parade of a
      spurious religion, which sacrificed character to a formal piety, was older
      than the Reformation, but it had been given a new emphasis by the
      reformers. Luther had denounced the demands of beggars as blackmail, and
      the Swiss reformers had stamped out the remnants of monastic charity, as a
      bribe ministered by Popery to dissoluteness and demoralization. “I
      conclude that all the large givings of the papists,” preached an English
      divine in the reign of Elizabeth, “of which at this day many make so great
      brags, because they be not done in a reverent regard of the commandment of
      the Lord, in love, and of an inward being touched with the calamities of
      the needy, but for to be well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg
      266]</span> reported of before men whilst they are alive, and to be prayed
      for after they are dead ... are indeed no alms, but pharisaical
      trumpets.”[<a href="#footnote-4-130" id="noteref-4-130">130</a>] The rise
      of a commercial civilization, the reaction against the authoritarian
      social policy of the Tudors, and the progress of Puritanism among the
      middle classes, all combined in the next half-century to sharpen the edge
      of that doctrine. Nurtured in a tradition which made the discipline of
      character by industry and self-denial the center of its ethical scheme,
      the Puritan moralist was undisturbed by any doubts as to whether even the
      seed of the righteous might not sometimes be constrained to beg its bread,
      and met the taunt that the repudiation of good works was the cloak for a
      conscienceless egoism with the retort that the easy-going open-handedness
      of the sentimentalist was not less selfish in its motives and was more
      corrupting to its objects. “As for idle beggars,” wrote Steele, “happy for
      them if fewer people spent their foolish pity upon their bodies, and if
      more shewed some wise compassion upon their souls.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-131" id="noteref-4-131">131</a>] That the greatest of
      evils is idleness, that the poor are the victims, not of circumstances,
      but of their own “idle, irregular and wicked courses,” that the truest
      charity is not to enervate them by relief, but so to reform their
      characters that relief may be unnecessary—such doctrines turned severity
      from a sin into a duty, and froze the impulse of natural pity with the
      assurance that, if indulged, it would perpetuate the suffering which it
      sought to allay.</p>
      <p>Few tricks of the unsophisticated intellect are more curious than the
      naïve psychology of the business man, who ascribes his achievements to his
      own unaided efforts, in bland unconsciousness of a social order without
      whose continuous support and vigilant protection he would be as a lamb
      bleating in the desert. That individualist complex owes part of its
      self-assurance to the suggestion of Puritan moralists, that practical
      success is at once the sign and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg
      267]</span> reward of ethical superiority. “No question,” argued a Puritan
      pamphleteer, “but it [riches] should be the portion rather of the godly
      than of the wicked, were it good for them; for godliness hath the promises
      of this life as well as of the life to come.”[<a href="#footnote-4-132"
      id="noteref-4-132">132</a>] The demonstration that distress is a proof of
      demerit, though a singular commentary on the lives of Christian saints and
      sages, has always been popular with the prosperous. By the lusty
      plutocracy of the Restoration, roaring after its meat, and not indisposed,
      if it could not find it elsewhere, to seek it from God, it was welcomed
      with a shout of applause.</p>
      <p>A society which reverences the attainment of riches as the supreme
      felicity will naturally be disposed to regard the poor as damned in the
      next world, if only to justify itself for making their life a hell in
      this. Advanced by men of religion as a tonic for the soul, the doctrine of
      the danger of pampering poverty was hailed by the rising school of
      Political Arithmeticians as a sovereign cure for the ills of society. For,
      if the theme of the moralist was that an easy-going indulgence undermined
      character, the theme of the economist was that it was economically
      disastrous and financially ruinous. The Poor Law is the mother of
      idleness, “men and women growing so idle and proud that they will not
      work, but lie upon the parish wherein they dwell for maintenance.” It
      discourages thrift; “if shame or fear of punishment makes him earn his
      dayly bread, he will do no more; his children are the charge of the parish
      and his old age his recess from labour or care.” It keeps up wages, since
      “it encourages wilful and evil-disposed persons to impose what wages they
      please upon their labours; and herein they are so refractory to reason and
      the benefit of the nation that, when corn and provisions are cheap, they
      will not work for less wages than when they were dear.”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-133" id="noteref-4-133">133</a>] To the landowner who
      cursed the poor-rates, and the clothier who grumbled at the high cost of
      labor, one school of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg
      268]</span> thought now brought the comforting assurance that morality
      itself would be favored by a reduction of both.</p>
      <p>As the history of the Poor Law in the nineteenth century was to prove,
      there is no touchstone, except the treatment of childhood, which reveals
      the true character of a social philosophy more clearly than the spirit in
      which it regards the misfortunes of those of its members who fall by the
      way. Such utterances on the subject of poverty were merely one example of
      a general attitude, which appeared at times to consign to collective
      perdition almost the whole of the wage-earning population. It was partly
      that, in an age which worshiped property as the foundation of the social
      order, the mere laborer seemed something less than a full citizen. It was
      partly the result of the greatly increased influence on thought and public
      affairs acquired at the Restoration by the commercial classes, whose
      temper was a ruthless materialism, determined at all costs to conquer
      world-markets from France and Holland, and prepared to sacrifice every
      other consideration to their economic ambitions. It was partly that, in
      spite of a century of large-scale production in textiles, the problems of
      capitalist industry and of a propertyless proletariat were still too novel
      for their essential features to be appreciated. Even those writers, like
      Baxter and Bunyan, who continued to insist on the wickedness of
      extortionate prices and unconscionable interest, rarely thought of
      applying their principles to the subject of wages. Their social theory had
      been designed for an age of petty agriculture and industry, in which
      personal relations had not yet been superseded by the cash nexus, and the
      craftsman or peasant farmer was but little removed in economic status from
      the half-dozen journeymen or laborers whom he employed. In a world
      increasingly dominated by great clothiers, iron-masters and mine-owners,
      they still adhered to the antiquated categories of master and servant,
      with the same obstinate indifference to<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span> economic realities as leads the twentieth
      century to talk of employers and employed, long after the individual
      employer has been converted into an impersonal corporation.</p>
      <p>In a famous passage of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, Marx observes
      that “the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, wherever it got the upper hand,
      put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations, pitilessly tore
      asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his ‘natural superiors,’
      and left remaining no other bond between man and man than naked
      self-interest and callous cash payment.”[<a href="#footnote-4-134"
      id="noteref-4-134">134</a>] An interesting illustration of his thesis
      might be found in the discussions of the economics of employment by
      English writers of the period between 1660 and 1760. Their characteristic
      was an attitude towards the new industrial proletariat noticeably harsher
      than that general in the first half of the seventeenth century, and which
      has no modern parallel except in the behavior of the less reputable of
      white colonists towards colored labor. The denunciations of the “luxury,
      pride and sloth”[<a href="#footnote-4-135" id="noteref-4-135">135</a>] of
      the English wage-earners of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are,
      indeed, almost exactly identical with those directed against African
      natives today. It is complained that, compared with the Dutch, they are
      self-indulgent and idle; that they want no more than a bare subsistence,
      and will cease work the moment they obtain it; that, the higher their
      wages, the more—“so licentious are they”[<a href="#footnote-4-136"
      id="noteref-4-136">136</a>]—they spend upon drink; that high prices,
      therefore, are not a misfortune, but a blessing, since they compel the
      wage-earner to be more industrious; and that high wages are not a
      blessing, but a misfortune, since they merely conduce to “weekly
      debauches.”</p>
      <p>When such doctrines were general, it was natural that the rigors of
      economic exploitation should be preached as a public duty, and, with a few
      exceptions, the writers of the period differed only as to the methods by
      which severity could most advantageously be organized. Pollexfen and<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> Walter Harris thought that
      salvation might be found by reducing the number of days kept as holidays.
      Bishop Berkeley, with the conditions of Ireland before his eyes, suggested
      that “sturdy beggars should ... be seized and made slaves to the public
      for a certain term of years.” Thomas Alcock, who was shocked at the
      workman’s taste for snuff, tea and ribbons, proposed the revival of
      sumptuary legislation.[<a href="#footnote-4-137"
      id="noteref-4-137">137</a>] The writers who advanced schemes for reformed
      workhouses, which should be places at once of punishment and of training,
      were innumerable. All were agreed that, on moral no less than on economic
      grounds, it was vital that wages should be reduced. The doctrine
      afterwards expressed by Arthur Young, when he wrote, “every one but an
      idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never
      be industrious,”[<a href="#footnote-4-138" id="noteref-4-138">138</a>] was
      the tritest commonplace of Restoration economists. It was not argued; it
      was accepted as self-evident.</p>
      <p>When philanthropists were inquiring whether it might not be desirable
      to reëstablish slavery, it was not to be expected that the sufferings of
      the destitute would wring their hearts with social compunction. The most
      curious feature in the whole discussion, and that which is most sharply in
      contrast with the long debate on pauperism carried on in the sixteenth
      century, was the resolute refusal to admit that society had any
      responsibility for the causes of distress. Tudor divines and statesmen had
      little mercy for idle rogues. But the former always, and the latter
      ultimately, regarded pauperism primarily as a social phenomenon produced
      by economic dislocation, and the embarrassing question put by the genial
      Harrison—“at whose handes shall the bloude of these men be required?”[<a
      href="#footnote-4-139" id="noteref-4-139">139</a>]—was never far from the
      minds even of the most cynical. Their successors after the Restoration
      were apparently quite unconscious that it was even conceivable that there
      might be any other cause of poverty than the moral failings of the poor.
      The practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
      conclusion to be drawn from so comfortable a creed was at once extremely
      simple and extremely agreeable. It was not to find employment under the
      Act of 1601, for to do that was only “to render the poor more bold.” It
      was to surround the right to relief with obstacles such as those contained
      in the Act of 1662, to give it, when it could not be avoided, in a
      workhouse or house of correction, and, for the rest, to increase the
      demand for labor by reducing wages.</p>
      <p>The grand discovery of a commercial age, that relief might be so
      administered as not merely to relieve, but also to deter, still remained
      to be made by Utilitarian philosophers. But the theory that distress was
      due, not to economic circumstances, but to what the Poor Law Commissioners
      of 1834 called “individual improvidence and vice,” was firmly established,
      and the criticism on the Elizabethan system which was to inspire the new
      Poor Law had already been formulated. The essence of that system was
      admirably expressed a century later by a Scottish divine as “the principle
      that each man, simply because he exists, holds a right on other men or on
      society for existence.”[<a href="#footnote-4-140"
      id="noteref-4-140">140</a>] Dr. Chalmers’ attack upon it was the echo of a
      note long struck by Puritan moralists. And the views of Dr. Chalmers had
      impressed themselves on Nassau Senior,[<a href="#footnote-4-141"
      id="noteref-4-141">141</a>] before he set his hand to that brilliant,
      influential and wildly unhistorical Report, which, after provoking
      something like a rebellion in the north of England, was to be one of the
      pillars of the social policy of the nineteenth century.</p>
      <p>It would be misleading to dwell on the limitations of Puritan ethics
      without emphasizing the enormous contribution of Puritanism to political
      freedom and social progress. The foundation of democracy is the sense of
      spiritual independence which nerves the individual to stand alone against
      the powers of this world, and in England, where squire and parson, lifting
      arrogant eyebrows at the insolence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg
      272]</span> of the lower orders, combined to crush popular agitation, as a
      menace at once to society and to the Church, it is probable that democracy
      owes more to Nonconformity than to any other single movement. The virtues
      of enterprise, diligence and thrift are the indispensable foundation of
      any complex and vigorous civilization. It was Puritanism which, by
      investing them with a supernatural sanction, turned them from an unsocial
      eccentricity into a habit and a religion. Nor would it be difficult to
      find notable representatives of the Puritan spirit in whom the personal
      austerity, which was the noblest aspect of the new ideal, was combined
      with a profound consciousness of social solidarity, which was the noblest
      aspect of that which it displaced. Firmin the philanthropist, and Bellers
      the Quaker, whom Owen more than a century later hailed as the father of
      his doctrines, were pioneers of Poor Law reform. The Society of Friends,
      in an age when the divorce between religion and social ethics was almost
      complete, met the prevalent doctrine, that it was permissible to take such
      gain as the market offered, by insisting on the obligation of good
      conscience and forbearance in economic transactions, and on the duty to
      make the honorable maintenance of the brother in distress a common
      charge.[<a href="#footnote-4-142" id="noteref-4-142">142</a>]</p>
      <p>The general climate and character of a country are not altered,
      however, by the fact that here and there it has peaks which rise into an
      ampler air. The distinctive note of Puritan teaching was different. It was
      individual responsibility, not social obligation. Training its pupils to
      the mastery of others through the mastery of self, it prized as a crown of
      glory the qualities which arm the spiritual athlete for his solitary
      contest with a hostile world, and dismissed concern with the social order
      as the prop of weaklings and the Capua of the soul. Both the excellences
      and the defects of that attitude were momentous for the future. It is
      sometimes suggested that the astonishing outburst of industrial
      activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span> which took
      place after 1760 created a new type of economic character, as well as a
      new system of economic organization. In reality, the ideal which was later
      to carry all before it, in the person of the inventor and engineer and
      captain of industry, was well established among Englishmen before the end
      of the seventeenth century. Among the numerous forces which had gone to
      form it, some not inconsiderable part may reasonably be ascribed to the
      emphasis on the life of business enterprise as the appropriate field for
      Christian endeavor, and on the qualities needed for success in it, which
      was characteristic of Puritanism. These qualities, and the admiration of
      them, remained, when the religious reference, and the restraints which it
      imposed, had weakened or disappeared.</p>

      <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>Societies, like
      individuals, have their moral crises and their spiritual revolutions. The
      student can observe the results which these cataclysms produce, but he can
      hardly without presumption attempt to appraise them, for it is at the fire
      which they kindled that his own small taper has been lit. The rise of a
      naturalistic science of society, with all its magnificent promise of
      fruitful action and of intellectual light; the abdication of the Christian
      Churches from departments of economic conduct and social theory long
      claimed as their province; the general acceptance by thinkers of a scale
      of ethical values, which turned the desire for pecuniary gain from a
      perilous, if natural, frailty into the idol of philosophers and the
      mainspring of society—such movements are written large over the history of
      the tempestuous age which lies between the Reformation and the full light
      of the eighteenth century. Their consequences have been worked into the
      very tissue of modern civilization. Posterity still stands too near their
      source to discern the ocean into which these streams will flow.</p>
      <p>In an historical age the relativity of political doctrines is the
      tritest of commonplaces. But social psychology continues too often to be
      discussed in serene indifference to the categories of time and place, and
      economic interests are still popularly treated as though they formed a
      kingdom over which the <i lang="de">Zeitgeist</i> bears no sway. In
      reality, though inherited dispositions may be constant from generation to
      generation, the system of valuations, preferences and ideals—the social
      environment within which individual character<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> functions—is in process of continuous
      change, and it is in the conception of the place to be assigned to
      economic interests in the life of society that change has in recent
      centuries been most comprehensive in its scope, and most sensational in
      its consequences. The isolation of economic aims as a specialized object
      of concentrated and systematic effort, the erection of economic criteria
      into an independent and authoritative standard of social expediency, are
      phenomena which, though familiar enough in classical antiquity, appear, at
      least on a grand scale, only at a comparatively recent date in the history
      of later civilizations. The conflict between the economic outlook of East
      and West, which impresses the traveller today, finds a parallel in the
      contrast between medieval and modern economic ideas, which strikes the
      historian.</p>
      <p>The elements which combined to produce that revolution are too numerous
      to be summarized in any neat formula. But, side by side with the expansion
      of trade and the rise of new classes to political power, there was a
      further cause, which, if not the most conspicuous, was not the least
      fundamental. It was the contraction of the territory within which the
      spirit of religion was conceived to run. The criticism which dismisses the
      concern of Churches with economic relations and social organization as a
      modern innovation finds little support in past history. What requires
      explanation is not the view that these matters are part of the province of
      religion, but the view that they are not. When the age of the Reformation
      begins, economics is still a branch of ethics, and ethics of theology; all
      human activities are treated as falling within a single scheme, whose
      character is determined by the spiritual destiny of mankind; the appeal of
      theorists is to natural law, not to utility; the legitimacy of economic
      transactions is tried by reference, less to the movements of the market,
      than to moral standards derived from the traditional teaching of the
      Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span> Church; the
      Church itself is regarded as a society wielding theoretical, and sometimes
      practical, authority in social affairs. The secularization of political
      thought, which was to be the work of the next two centuries, had profound
      reactions on social speculation, and by the Restoration the whole
      perspective, at least in England, has been revolutionized. Religion has
      been converted from the keystone which holds together the social edifice
      into one department within it, and the idea of a rule of right is replaced
      by economic expediency as the arbiter of policy and the criterion of
      conduct. From a spiritual being, who, in order to survive, must devote a
      reasonable attention to economic interest, man seems sometimes to have
      become an economic animal, who will be prudent, nevertheless, if he takes
      due precautions to assure his spiritual well-being.</p>
      <p>The result is an attitude which forms so fundamental a part of modern
      political thought, that both its precarious philosophical basis, and the
      contrast which it offers with the conceptions of earlier generations, are
      commonly forgotten. Its essence is a dualism which regards the secular and
      the religious aspects of life, not as successive stages within a larger
      unity, but as parallel and independent provinces, governed by different
      laws, judged by different standards, and amenable to different
      authorities. To the most representative minds of the Reformation, as of
      the Middle Ages, a philosophy which treated the transactions of commerce
      and the institutions of society as indifferent to religion would have
      appeared, not merely morally reprehensible, but intellectually absurd.
      Holding as their first assumption that the ultimate social authority is
      the will of God, and that temporal interests are a transitory episode in
      the life of spirits which are eternal, they state the rules to which the
      social conduct of the Christian must conform, and, when circumstances
      allow, organize the discipline by which those rules may be enforced. By
      their successors in the eighteenth century<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span> the philosophy of Indifferentism, though
      rarely formulated as a matter of theory, is held in practice as a truism
      which it is irrational, if not actually immoral, to question, since it is
      in the heart of the individual that religion has its throne, and to
      externalize it in rules and institutions is to tarnish its purity and to
      degrade its appeal. Naturally, therefore, they formulate the ethical
      principles of Christianity in terms of a comfortable ambiguity, and rarely
      indicate with any precision their application to commerce, finance, and
      the ownership of property. Thus the conflict between religion and those
      natural economic ambitions which the thought of an earlier age had
      regarded with suspicion is suspended by a truce which divides the life of
      mankind between them. The former takes as its province the individual
      soul, the latter the intercourse of man with his fellows in the activities
      of business and the affairs of society. Provided that each keeps to its
      own territory, peace is assured. They cannot collide, for they can never
      meet.</p>
      <p>History is a stage where forces which are within human control contend
      and coöperate with forces which are not. The change of opinion described
      in these pages drew nourishment from both. The storm and fury of the
      Puritan revolution had been followed by a dazzling outburst of economic
      enterprise, and the transformation of the material environment prepared an
      atmosphere in which a judicious moderation seemed the voice at once of the
      truest wisdom and the sincerest piety. But the inner world was in motion
      as well as the outer. The march of external progress woke sympathetic
      echoes in hearts already attuned to applaud its triumph, and there was no
      consciousness of an acute tension between the claims of religion and the
      glittering allurements of a commercial civilization, such as had tormented
      the age of the Reformation.</p>
      <p>It was partly the natural, and not unreasonable, diffidence of men who
      were conscious that traditional doctrines of<span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span> social ethics, with their impracticable
      distrust of economic motives, belonged to the conditions of a vanished
      age, but who lacked the creative energy to state them anew, in a form
      applicable to the needs of a more complex and mobile social order. It was
      partly that political changes had gone far to identify the Church of
      England with the ruling aristocracy, so that, while in France, when the
      crash came, many of the lower clergy threw in their lot with the <i
      lang="fr">tiers état</i>, in England it was rarely that the officers of
      the Church did not echo the views of society which commended themselves to
      the rulers of the State. It was partly that, to one important body of
      opinion, the very heart of religion was a spirit which made indifference
      to the gross world of external circumstances appear, not a defect, but an
      ornament of the soul. Untrammelled by the silken chains which bound the
      Establishment, and with a great tradition of discipline behind them, the
      Nonconformist Churches might seem to have possessed opportunities of
      reasserting the social obligations of religion with a vigor denied to the
      Church of England. What impeded their utterance was less a weakness than
      the most essential and distinctive of their virtues. Founded on the
      repudiation of the idea that human effort could avail to win salvation, or
      human aid to assist the pilgrim in his lonely quest, they saw the world of
      business and society as a battlefield, across which character could march
      triumphant to its goal, not as crude materials waiting the architect’s
      hand to set them in their place as the foundations of the Kingdom of
      Heaven. It did not occur to them that character is social, and society,
      since it is the expression of character, spiritual. Thus the eye is
      sometimes blinded by light itself.</p>
      <p>The certainties of one age are the problems of the next. Few will
      refuse their admiration to the magnificent conception of a community
      penetrated from apex to foundation by the moral law, which was the
      inspiration of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg
      282]</span> reformers, not less than of the better minds of the Middle
      Ages. But, in order to subdue the tough world of material interests, it is
      necessary to have at least so much sympathy with its tortuous ways as is
      needed to understand them. The Prince of Darkness has a right to a
      courteous hearing and a fair trial, and those who will not give him his
      due are wont to find that, in the long run, he turns the tables by taking
      his due and something over. Common sense and a respect for realities are
      not less graces of the spirit than moral zeal. The paroxysms of virtuous
      fury, with which the children of light denounced each new victory of
      economic enterprise as yet another stratagem of Mammon, disabled them for
      the staff-work of their campaign, which needs a cool head as well as a
      stout heart. Their obstinate refusal to revise old formulæ in the light of
      new facts exposed them helpless to a counter-attack, in which the whole
      fabric of their philosophy, truth and fantasy alike, was overwhelmed
      together. They despised knowledge, and knowledge destroyed them.</p>
      <p>Few can contemplate without a sense of exhilaration the splendid
      achievements of practical energy and technical skill, which, from the
      latter part of the seventeenth century, were transforming the face of
      material civilization, and of which England was the daring, if not too
      scrupulous, pioneer. If, however, economic ambitions are good servants,
      they are bad masters. Harnessed to a social purpose, they will turn the
      mill and grind the corn. But the question, to what end the wheels revolve,
      still remains; and on that question the naïve and uncritical worship of
      economic power, which is the mood of unreason too often engendered in
      those whom that new Leviathan has hypnotized by its spell, throws no
      light. Its result is not seldom a world in which men commands a mechanism
      that they cannot fully use, and an organization which has every perfection
      except that of motion.</p>

      <p class="continued">The shaft of Mephistopheles, which drops harmless
      from the armor of Reason, pierces the lazy caricature which masquerades
      beneath that sacred name, to flatter its followers with the smiling
      illusion of progress won from the mastery of the material environment by a
      race too selfish and superficial to determine the purpose to which its
      triumphs shall be applied. Mankind may wring her secrets from nature, and
      use their knowledge to destroy themselves; they may command the Ariels of
      heat and motion, and bind their wings in helpless frustration, while they
      wrangle over the question of the master whom the imprisoned genii shall
      serve. Whether the chemist shall provide them with the means of life or
      with tri-nitro-toluol and poison gas, whether industry shall straighten
      the bent back or crush it beneath heavier burdens, depends on an act of
      choice between incompatible ideals, for which no increase in the apparatus
      of civilization at man’s disposal is in itself a substitute. Economic
      efficiency is a necessary element in the life of any sane and vigorous
      society, and only the incorrigible sentimentalist will depreciate its
      significance. But to convert efficiency from an instrument into a primary
      object is to destroy efficiency itself. For the condition of effective
      action in a complex civilization is coöperation. And the condition of
      coöperation is agreement, both as to the ends to which effort should be
      applied, and the criteria by which its success is to be judged.</p>
      <p>Agreement as to ends implies the acceptance of a standard of values, by
      which the position to be assigned to different objects may be determined.
      In a world of limited resources, where nature yields a return only to
      prolonged and systematic effort, such a standard must obviously take
      account of economic possibilities. But it cannot itself be<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span> merely economic, since the
      comparative importance of economic and of other interests—the sacrifice,
      for example, of material goods worth incurring in order to extend leisure,
      or develop education, or humanize toil—is precisely the point on which it
      is needed to throw light. It must be based on some conception of the
      requirements of human nature as a whole, to which the satisfaction of
      economic needs is evidently vital, but which demands the satisfaction of
      other needs as well, and which can organize its activities on a rational
      system only in so far as it has a clear apprehension of their relative
      significance. “Whatever the world thinks,” wrote Bishop Berkeley, “he who
      hath not much meditated upon God, the human mind and the <i
      lang="la">summum bonum</i>
      may possibly make a thriving earthworm, but will most indubitably make a
      sorry patriot and a sorry statesman.” The philosopher of today, who bids
      us base our hopes of progress on knowledge inspired by love, does not
      differ from the Bishop so much, perhaps, as he would wish. The most
      obvious facts are the most easily forgotten. Both the existing economic
      order, and too many of the projects advanced for reconstructing it, break
      down through their neglect of the truism that, since even quite common men
      have souls, no increase in material wealth will compensate them for
      arrangements which insult their self-respect and impair their freedom. A
      reasonable estimate of economic organization must allow for the fact that,
      unless industry is to be paralyzed by recurrent revolts on the part of
      outraged human nature, it must satisfy criteria which are not purely
      economic. A reasonable view of its possible modifications must recognize
      that natural appetites may be purified or restrained, as, in fact, in some
      considerable measure they already have been, by being submitted to the
      control of some larger body of interests. The distinction made by the
      philosophers of classical antiquity between liberal and servile
      occupations, the medieval insistence that riches exist<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span> for man, not man for riches,
      Ruskin’s famous outburst, “there is no wealth but life,” the argument of
      the Socialist who urges that production should be organized for service,
      not for profit, are but different attempts to emphasize the instrumental
      character of economic activities by reference to an ideal which is held to
      express the true nature of man.</p>
      <p>Of that nature and its possibilities the Christian Church was thought,
      during the greater part of the period discussed in these pages, to hold by
      definition a conception distinctively its own. It was therefore committed
      to the formulation of a social theory, not as a philanthropic gloss upon
      the main body of its teaching, but as a vital element in a creed concerned
      with the destiny of men whose character is formed, and whose spiritual
      potentialities are fostered or starved, by the commerce of the
      market-place and the institutions of society. Stripped of the
      eccentricities of period and place, its philosophy had as its center a
      determination to assert the superiority of moral principles over economic
      appetites, which have their place, and an important place, in the human
      scheme, but which, like other natural appetites, when flattered and
      pampered and overfed, bring ruin to the soul and confusion to society. Its
      casuistry was an attempt to translate these principles into a code of
      practical ethics, sufficiently precise to be applied to the dusty world of
      warehouse and farm. Its discipline was an effort, too often corrupt and
      pettifogging in practice, but not ignoble in conception, to work the
      Christian virtues into the spotted texture of individual character and
      social conduct. That practice was often a sorry parody on theory is a
      truism which should need no emphasis. But in a world where principles and
      conduct are unequally mated, men are to be judged by their reach as well
      as by their grasp—by the ends at which they aim as well as by the success
      with which they attain them. The prudent critic will try himself by his
      achievement rather than by his ideals, and his neighbors,<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> living and dead alike, by
      their ideals not less than by their achievement.</p>
      <p>Circumstances alter from age to age, and the practical interpretation
      of moral principles must alter with them. Few who consider dispassionately
      the facts of social history will be disposed to deny that the exploitation
      of the weak by the powerful, organized for purposes of economic gain,
      buttressed by imposing systems of law, and screened by decorous draperies
      of virtuous sentiment and resounding rhetoric, has been a permanent
      feature in the life of most communities that the world has yet seen. But
      the quality in modern societies which is most sharply opposed to the
      teaching ascribed to the Founder of the Christian Faith lies deeper than
      the exceptional failures and abnormal follies against which criticism is
      most commonly directed. It consists in the assumption, accepted by most
      reformers with hardly less <i lang="fr">naïveté</i> than by the defenders
      of the established order, that the attainment of material riches is the
      supreme object of human endeavor and the final criterion of human success.
      Such a philosophy, plausible, militant, and not indisposed, when hard
      pressed, to silence criticism by persecution, may triumph or may decline.
      What is certain is that it is the negation of any system of thought or
      morals which can, except by a metaphor, be described as Christian.
      Compromise is as impossible between the Church of Christ and the idolatry
      of wealth, which is the practical religion of capitalist societies, as it
      was between the Church and the State idolatry of the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p>“Modern capitalism,” writes Mr. Keynes, “is absolutely irreligious,
      without internal union, without much public spirit, often, though not
      always, a mere congeries of possessors and pursuers.” It is that whole
      system of appetites and values, with its deification of the life of
      snatching to hoard, and hoarding to snatch, which now, in the hour of its
      triumph, while the plaudits of the crowd still ring in the<span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> ears of the gladiators and
      the laurels are still unfaded on their brows, seems sometimes to leave a
      taste as of ashes on the lips of a civilization which has brought to the
      conquest of its material environment resources unknown in earlier ages,
      but which has not yet learned to master itself. It was against that
      system, while still in its supple and insinuating youth, before success
      had caused it to throw aside the mask of innocence, and while its true
      nature was unknown even to itself, that the saints and sages of earlier
      ages launched their warnings and their denunciations. The language in
      which theologians and preachers expressed their horror of the sin of
      covetousness may appear to the modern reader too murkily sulphurous; their
      precepts on the contracts of business and the disposition of property may
      seem an impracticable pedantry. But rashness is a more agreeable failing
      than cowardice, and, when to speak is unpopular, it is less pardonable to
      be silent than to say too much. Posterity has, perhaps, as much to learn
      from the whirlwind eloquence with which Latimer scourged injustice and
      oppression as from the sober respectability of the judicious Paley—who
      himself, since there are depths below depths, was regarded as a dangerous
      revolutionary by George <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>.</p>

        Nicholas Oresme, <i>c.</i> 1320-82, Bishop of Lisieux from 1377. His <i

        apprentices, and must not be pressed too far. The conclusion of Martin
        Saint-Léon is: “Il est certain qu’au moyen âge (abstraction faite des
        villes de Flandre) il n’existait pas encore un prolétariat, le nombre

        <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> <abbr title="28">xxviii</abbr>
        (<i>Select English Works of Wyclif</i>, <abbr title="edited
        by">ed.</abbr> T. Arnold, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr
        title="3">iii</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 333). The passage
        contains comprehensive denunciations of all sorts of combination, in
        particular, gilds, “men of sutel craft, as fre masons and othere,” and
        “marchauntis, groceris, and vitileris” who “conspiren wickidly togidre
        that noon of hem schal bie over a certeyn pris, though the thing that
        thei bien be moche more worthi” (<i lang="la">ibid.</i>, <abbr
        title="pages">pp.</abbr> 333, 334).</p>
        <p>Wyclif’s argument is of great interest and importance. It is (1),
        that such associations for mutual aid are unnecessary. No special
        institutions are needed to promote fraternity, since, quite apart from
        them, all members of the community are bound to help each other: “Alle
        the goodnes that is in thes gildes eche man owith for to do bi comyn
        fraternyte of Cristendom, by Goddis comaundement.” (2) That combinations
        are a conspiracy against the public. Both doctrines were points in the
        case for the sovereignty of the unitary State, and both were to play a
        large part in subsequent history. They were used by the absolutist
        statesmen of the sixteenth century as an argument for State control over
        industry, in place of the obstructive torpor of gilds and boroughs, and
        by the individualists of the eighteenth century as an argument for free
        competition. The line of thought as to the relation of minor
        associations to the State runs from Wyclif to Turgot, Rousseau, Adam
        Smith, the Act of the Legislative Assembly in 1792 forbidding trade
        unions (“Les citoyens de même état ou profession, les ouvriers et
        compagnons d’un art quelconque ne pourront ... former des règlements sur
        leurs prétendus intérêts communs”), and the English Combination
        Acts.</p>

        propos</i> of a ruling of 1270, fixing minimum rates for textile workers
        in Paris. It appears, however, to be unduly optimistic. The fact that
        minimum rates were fixed for textile workers must not be taken as
        evidence that that policy was common, for in England, and probably in
        France, the textile trades received special treatment, and minimum rates
        were fixed for them, while maximum rates were fixed for other, and much
        more numerous, bodies of workers. What is true is that the medieval
        assumption with regard to wages, as with regard to the much more
        important question of prices, was that it was possible to bring them
        into an agreement with an objective standard of equity, which did not
        reflect the mere play of economic forces.</p>

        to inquire: “Whether [the priest] feeds his flock, assisting those who
        are in need and above all those who are sick. Works of mercy also are to
        be suggested by the archdeacon, to be done by him for their assistance.
        If he cannot fully accomplish them out of his own resources, he ought,
        according to his power, to use his personal influence to get from others
        the means of carrying them out.... Inquiries concerning the parishioners
        are to be made, both from the priest and from others among them worthy
        of credence, who, if necessary, are to be summoned for the purpose to
        the presence of the archdeacon, as well as from the neighbours, with
        regard to matters which appear to need correction. First, inquiry is to
        be made whether there are notorious usurers, or persons reputed to be
        usurers, and what sort of usury they practise, whether any one, that is
        to say, lends money or anything else ... on condition that he receive
        anything above the principal, or holds any pledge and takes profits from
        it in excess of the principal, or receives pledges and uses them in the
        meantime for his own gain; ... whether he holds horses in pledge and
        reckons in the cost of their fodder more than they can eat ... or<span
        class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> whether he buys anything
        at a much lower price than it is worth, on condition that the seller can
        take it back at a fixed term on paying the price, though the buyer knows
        that he (the seller) will not be able to do so; or whether he buys
        anything for a less price than it is worth, because he pays before
        receiving the article, for example, standing corn; or whether any one,
        as a matter of custom and without express contract, is wont to take
        payment above the principal, as the Cahorsines do.... Further, it is to
        be inquired whether he practises usury cloaked under the guise of a
        partnership (<i lang="la">nomine societatis palliatam</i>), as when a
        man lends money to a merchant, on condition that he be a partner in the
        gains, but not in the losses.... Further, whether he practises usury
        cloaked under the guise of a penalty, that is to say, when his intention
        in imposing a penalty [for non-payment at a given date] is not that he
        may be paid more quickly, but that he may be paid more. Further, whether
        he practises usury in kind, as when a rich man, who has lent money, will
        not receive from a poor man any money above the principal, but agrees
        that he shall work two days in his vineyard, or something of the kind.
        Further, whether he practises usury cloaked by reference to a third
        party, as when a man will not lend himself, but has a friend whom he
        induces to lend. When it has been ascertained how many persons in that
        parish are notorious for usury of this kind, their names are to be
        reduced to writing, and the archdeacon is to proceed against them in
        virtue of his office, causing them to be cited to his court on a day
        fixed, either before himself or his responsible official, even if there
        is no accuser, on the ground that they are accused by common report. If
        they are convicted, either because their offence is evident, or by their
        own confession, or by witnesses, he is to punish them as he thinks
        best.... If they cannot be directly convicted, by reason of their
        manifold shifts and stratagems, nevertheless their ill fame as usurers
        can easily be established.... If the archdeacon proceed with caution and
        diligence against their wicked doings, they will hardly be able to hold
        their own or to escape—if, that is ... he vex them with trouble and
        expense, and humiliate them, by frequently serving citations on them and
        assigning several different days for their trial, so that by trouble,
        expense, loss of time, and all manner of confusion they may be induced
        to repent and submit themselves to the discipline of the Church.”</p>

        <p>Pecock’s defence of the necessity of commentaries on the teaching of
        Scripture was the real answer to the statement afterwards made by Luther
        that the text, “Love thy neighbour as thyself,” was an all-sufficient
        guide to action (see <abbr title="chapter">Chap.</abbr> <abbr

        thorough examination of the <i>Early Chancery Proceedings</i> would show
        that, even in the fifteenth century, the jurisdiction of the
        ecclesiastical courts in matters of contract and usury was of greater

        An article of the German Peasants’ program in 1525 declared: “For men to
        hold us as their own property ... is pitiable enough, considering that
        Christ has delivered and redeemed us all, the lowly as well as the
        great, without exception, by the shedding of His precious blood.
        Accordingly it is consistent with Scripture that we should be free.”
        (The program is printed in J. S. Schapiro, <i>Social Reform and the
        Reformation</i>, 1909, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 137-42.) The

        expressed later by the Rev. J. Townsend, in his <i>Dissertation on the

        distinguish us, get a law made we shall buy no lands, that we may not be
        freeholders; and see if you could find money to buy us out. Transplant
        us into towns and bodies, and let us trade by our selves; let us card,

        our money out of your Bank, accept none of our bills, and separate your

        <p>Weber’s essay gave rise to much discussion in Germany. Its main
        thesis—that Calvinism, and in particular English Puritanism, from which
        nearly all his illustrations are drawn, played a part of preponderant
        importance in creating moral and political conditions favorable to the
        growth of capitalist enterprise—appears to be accepted by Troeltsch, <i
        lang="de">Die Soziallehren der Christlichen Kirchen</i>, <abbr
        title="pages">pp.</abbr> 704 <i lang="la">seqq.</i> It is submitted to a
        critical analysis by Brentano (<i lang="de">Die Anfänge des modernen
        Kapitalismus</i>, 1916, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 117-57), who
        dissents from many of Weber’s conclusions. Weber’s essay is certainly
        one of the most fruitful examinations of the relations between religion
        and social theory which has appeared, and I desire to acknowledge my
        indebtedness to it, in particular with reference to its discussion of
        the economic application given by some Puritan writers to the idea
        expressed by the word “calling.” At the same time, there are several
        points on which Weber’s arguments appear to me to be one-sided and
        overstrained, and on which Brentano’s criticisms of it seem to me to be
        sound.</p>
        <p>Thus (<abbr title="1">i</abbr>), as was perhaps inevitable in an
        essay dealing with economic and social thought, as distinct from changes
        in economic and social organization, Weber seems to me to explain by
        reference to moral and intellectual influences developments which have
        their principal explanation in another region altogether. There was
        plenty of the “capitalist spirit” in fifteenth-century Venice and
        Florence, or in south Germany and Flanders, for the simple reason that
        these areas were the greatest commercial and financial centers of the
        age, though all were, at least nominally, Catholic. The development of
        capitalism in Holland and England in the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries was due, not to the fact that they were Protestant powers, but
        to large economic movements, in particular the Discoveries and the
        results which flowed from them. Of course material and psychological
        changes went together, and of course the second reacted on the first.
        But it seems a little artificial to talk as though capitalist enterprise
        could not appear till religious changes had produced a capitalist
        spirit. It would be equally true, and equally one-sided, to say that the
        religious changes were purely the result of economic movements.</p>
        <p>(<abbr title="2">ii</abbr>) Weber ignores, or at least touches too
        lightly on, intellectual movements, which were favorable to the growth
        of business enterprise and to an individualist attitude towards economic
        relations, but which had little to do with religion. The political
        thought of the Renaissance was one; as Brentano points out, Machiavelli
        was at least as powerful a solvent of traditional ethical restraints as
        Calvin. The speculations of business men and economists on money, prices
        and the foreign exchanges were a second. Both contributed to the temper
        of single-minded concentration on pecuniary gain, which Weber
        understands by the capitalist spirit.</p>
        <p>(<abbr title="3">iii</abbr>) He appears greatly to over-simplify
        Calvinism itself. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg
        317]</span> first place, he apparently ascribes to the English Puritans
        of the seventeenth century the conception of social ethics held by
        Calvin and his immediate followers. In the second place, he speaks as
        though all English Puritans in the seventeenth century held much the
        same view of social duties and expediency. Both suggestions are
        misleading. On the one hand, the Calvinists of the sixteenth century
        (including English Puritans) were believers in a rigorous discipline,
        and the individualism ascribed not unjustly to the Puritan movement in
        its later phases would have horrified them. The really significant
        question is that of the causes of the change from the one standpoint to
        the other, a question which Weber appears to ignore. On the other hand,
        there were within seventeenth-century Puritanism a variety of elements,
        which held widely different views as to social policy. As Cromwell
        discovered, there was no formula which would gather Puritan aristocrats
        and Levellers, landowners and Diggers, merchants and artisans, buff-coat
        and his general, into the fold of a single social theory. The issue
        between divergent doctrines was fought out within the Puritan movement
        itself. Some won; others lost.</p>
        <p>Both “the capitalist spirit” and “Protestant ethics,” therefore, were
        a good deal more complex than Weber seems to imply. What is true and
        valuable in his essay is his insistence that the commercial classes in
        seventeenth-century England were the standard-bearers of a particular
        conception of social expediency, which was markedly different from that
        of the more conservative elements in society—the peasants, the
        craftsmen, and many landed gentry—and that that conception found
        expression in religion, in politics, and, not least, in social and
        economic conduct and policy.</p>

        For the influence of Chalmers’ idea on Senior, and, through him, on the
        new Poor Law of 1834, see T. Mackay, <i>History of the English Poor
        Law</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>,
        1899, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 32-4. Chalmers held that <i>any</i>
        Poor Law was in itself objectionable. Senior, who described Chalmers’
        evidence before the Committee on the State of the Poor in Ireland as
        “the most instructive, perhaps, that ever was given before a Committee
        of the House of Commons,” appears to have begun by agreeing with him,
        but later to have adopted the principle of deterrence, backed by the
        test workhouse, as a second best. The Commissioners of 1832-4 were right
        in thinking the existing methods of relief administration extremely bad;
        they were wrong in supposing distress to be due mainly to lax
        administration, instead of realizing, as was the fact, that lax
        administration had arisen as an attempt to meet the increase of
        distress. Their discussion of the causes of pauperism is, therefore,
        extremely superficial, and requires to be supplemented by the evidence
        contained in the various contemporary reports (such, <i>e.g.</i>, as
        those on the hand-loom weavers) dealing with the industrial aspects of
        the problem.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
